Our understanding of the cell types that make up the brain is rapidly accelerating, driven in particular by recent advances in single-cell transcriptomics. However, understanding brain function, development, and disease will require linking molecular cell types to morphological, physiological, and behavioral correlates. Emerging spatially resolved transcriptomic methods promise to fill this gap by localizing molecularly defined cell types in tissues, with simultaneous detection of morphology, activity, or connectivity. Here, we review the requirements for spatial transcriptomic methods toward these goals, consider the challenges ahead, and describe promising applications.},

   abstract = {Spatial resolution of gene expression enables gene expression events to be pinpointed to a specific location in biological tissue. Spatially resolved gene expression in tissue sections is traditionally analyzed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) or in situ hybridization (ISH). These technologies are invaluable tools for pathologists and molecular biologists; however, their throughput is limited to the analysis of only a few genes at a time. Recent advances in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) have made it possible to obtain unbiased high-throughput gene expression data in bulk. Spatial Transcriptomics combines the benefits of traditional spatially resolved technologies with the massive throughput of RNA-seq. Here, we present a protocol describing how to apply the Spatial Transcriptomics technology to mammalian tissue. This protocol combines histological staining and spatially resolved RNA-seq data from intact tissue sections. Once suitable tissue-specific conditions have been established, library construction and sequencing can be completed in ~5–6 d. Data processing takes a few hours, with the exact timing dependent on the sequencing depth. Our method requires no special instruments and can be performed in any laboratory with access to a cryostat, microscope and next-generation sequencing.},

Further insights into the mechanisms underlying melanoma are crucial for understanding tumor progression and responses to treatment. Here we adapted the technology of spatial transcriptomics (ST) to melanoma lymph node biopsies and successfully sequenced the transcriptomes of over 2,200 tissue domains. Deconvolution combined with traditional approaches for dimensional reduction of transcriptome-wide data enabled us to both visualize the transcriptional landscape within the tissue and identify gene expression profiles linked to specific histologic entities. Our unsupervised analysis revealed a complex spatial intratumoral composition of melanoma metastases that was not evident through morphologic annotation. Each biopsy showed distinct gene expression profiles and included examples of the coexistence of multiple melanoma signatures within a single tumor region as well as shared profiles for lymphoid tissue characterized according to their spatial location and gene expression profiles. The lymphoid area in close proximity to the tumor region displayed a specific expression pattern, which may reflect the TME, a key component to fully understanding tumor progression. In conclusion, using the ST technology to generate gene expression profiles reveals a detailed landscape of melanoma metastases. This should inspire researchers to integrate spatial information into analyses aiming to identify the factors underlying tumor progression and therapy outcome.},

Here, we increased the gene throughput of MERFISH and demonstrated simultaneous measurements of RNA transcripts from ∼10,000 genes in individual cells with ∼80% detection efficiency and ∼4% misidentification rate. We combined MERFISH with cellular structure imaging to determine subcellular compartmentalization of RNAs. We validated this approach by showing enrichment of secretome transcripts at the endoplasmic reticulum, and further revealed enrichment of long noncoding RNAs, RNAs with retained introns, and a subgroup of protein-coding mRNAs in the cell nucleus. Leveraging spatially resolved RNA profiling, we developed an approach to determine RNA velocity in situ using the balance of nuclear versus cytoplasmic RNA counts. We applied this approach to infer pseudotime ordering of cells and identified cells at different cell-cycle states, revealing ∼1,600 genes with putative cell cycle-dependent expression and a gradual transcription profile change as cells progress through cell-cycle stages. Our analysis further revealed cell cycle-dependent and cell cycle-independent spatial heterogeneity of transcriptionally distinct cells.

However, background-from off-target binding of FISH probes and cellular autofluorescence-can become limiting in a number of important applications, such as increasing the degree of multiplexing, imaging shorter RNAs, and imaging tissue samples. Here, we developed a sample clearing approach for FISH measurements. We identified off-target binding of FISH probes to cellular components other than RNA, such as proteins, as a major source of background. To remove this source of background, we embedded samples in polyacrylamide, anchored RNAs to this polyacrylamide matrix, and cleared cellular proteins and lipids, which are also sources of autofluorescence. To demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, we measured the copy number of 130 RNA species in cleared samples using multiplexed error-robust FISH (MERFISH). We observed a reduction both in the background because of off-target probe binding and in the cellular autofluorescence without detectable loss in RNA. This process led to an improved detection efficiency and detection limit of MERFISH, and an increased measurement throughput via extension of MERFISH into four color channels. We further demonstrated MERFISH measurements of complex tissue samples from the mouse brain using this matrix-imprinting and-clearing approach. We envision that this method will improve the performance of a wide range of in situ hybridization-based techniques in both cell culture and tissues.},

Results: Here we present a pipeline to automatically and efficiently process RNA-seq data obtained from spatial transcriptomics experiments to generate datasets for downstream analysis.

   abstract = {Gene expression variability in mammalian systems plays an important role in physiological and pathophysiological conditions. This variability can come from differential regulation related to cell state (extrinsic) and allele-specific transcriptional bursting (intrinsic). Yet, the relative contribution of these two distinct sources is unknown. Here we exploit the qualitative difference in the patterns of covariance between these two sources to quantify their relative contributions to expression variance in mammalian cells. Using multiplexed error robust RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (MERFISH) we measured the multivariate gene expression distribution of 150 genes related to Ca2+ signaling coupled with the dynamic Ca2+ response of live cells to ATP. We show that after controlling for cellular phenotypic states such as size, cell cycle stage, and Ca2+ response to ATP, the remaining variability is effectively at the Poisson limit for most genes. These findings demonstrate that the majority of expression variability results from cell state differences and that the contribution of transcriptional bursting is relatively minimal.},

   abstract = {Pooled-library CRISPR screening provides a powerful means to discover genetic factors involved in cellular processes in a high-throughput manner. However, the phenotypes accessible to pooled-library screening are limited. Complex phenotypes, such as cellular morphology and subcellular molecular organization, as well as their dynamics, require imaging-based readout and are currently beyond the reach of pooled-library CRISPR screening. Here we report an all imaging-based pooled-library CRISPR screening approach that combines high-content phenotype imaging with high-throughput single guide RNA (sgRNA) identification in individual cells. In this approach, sgRNAs are codelivered to cells with corresponding barcodes placed at the 3′ untranslated region of a reporter gene using a lentiviral delivery system with reduced recombination-induced sgRNA-barcode mispairing. Multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) is used to read out the barcodes and hence identify the sgRNAs with high accuracy. We used this approach to screen 162 sgRNAs targeting 54 RNA-binding proteins for their effects on RNA localization to nuclear compartments and uncovered previously unknown regulatory factors for nuclear RNA localization. Notably, our screen revealed both positive and negative regulators for the nuclear speckle localization of a long noncoding RNA, MALAT1, suggesting a dynamic regulation of lncRNA localization in subcellular compartments.},

The approach is analogous to a powerful method of bacterial genetics, the random generation of operon fusions, that enables the isolation and characterization of genes simply by knowing or postulating their pattern of expression; it is not necessary initially to screen for mutant phenotypes. To apply this approach to Drosophila, we have used the expression of the lacZ gene of Escherichia coli from the P-element promoter in germ-line transformant flies to screen for chromosomal elements that can act at a distance to stimulate expression from this apparently weak promoter. Of 49 transformed fly lines obtained, approximately 70% show some type of spatially regulated expression of the lacZ gene in embryos; many of these express lacZ specifically in the nervous system. The P-lacZ fusion gene is, therefore, an efficient tool for the recovery of elements that may regulate gene expression in Drosophila and for the generation of a wide variety of cell-type-specific markers.},

   abstract = {In a large-scale gene expression screen 1765 randomly picked cDNAs were analyzed by whole-mount in situ hybridization in Xenopus embryos. Two hundred and seventy three unique, differentially expressed genes were identified, 204 of which are novel in Xenopus. Partial DNA sequences and expression patterns were documented and assembled into a database, 'AXelDB'. Approximately 30% of cDNAs analyzed represent differentially expressed genes and about 5% show highly regionalized expression. Novel marker genes and potential developmental regulators were found. Differential expression of mitochondrial genes was observed. Marker genes were used to study regionalization of the entire gastrula as well as the tail forming region and the epidermis of the tailbud embryo. Four 'synexpression' groups representing genes with shared, complex expression pattern that predict molecular pathways involved in patterning and differentiation were identified. According to their probable functional significance these groups are designated as Delta1, Bmp4, ER- import and Chromatin group. Within synexpression groups, a likely function of genes without sequence similarity can be predicted. The results indicate that synexpression groups have strong prognostic value. A cluster analysis was made by comparing gene expression patterns to derive a novel parameter, 'tissue relatedness'. In conclusion, this study describes a semi-functional approach to investigate genes expressed during early development and provides global insight into embryonic patterning.},

Virtual 3D anatomical models are generated from intact specimens using optical projection tomography (OPT). Using mapaint software, selected gene expression data, gathered using standard methods of in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, are mapped to a representative 3D model for each chosen Carnegie stage. In these models, anatomical domains, defined on the basis of morphological landmarks and comparative knowledge of expression patterns in vertebrates, are linked to a developmental neuroanatomic ontology. Human gene expression patterns for genes with characteristic expression in different vertebrates (e.g. PAX6, GAD65 and OLIG2) are being used to confirm and/or refine the human anatomical domain boundaries. We have also developed interpolation software that digitally generates a full domain from partial data. Currently, the 3D models and a preliminary set of anatomical domains and ontology are available on the atlas pages along with gene expression data from approximately 100 genes in the HUDSEN Human Spatial Gene Expression Database (http://www.hudsen.org). The aim is that full 3D data will be generated from expression data used to define a more detailed set of anatomical domains linked to a more advanced anatomy ontology and all of these will be available online, contributing to the long-term goal of the atlas, which is to help maximize the effective use and dissemination of data wherever it is generated. © 2010 The Authors.

   abstract = {Relative positions of neurons within mature murine pelvic ganglia based on expression of neurotransmitters have been described. However the spatial organization of developing innervation in the murine urogenital tract (UGT) and the gene networks that regulate specification and maturation of neurons within the pelvic ganglia of the lower urinary tract (LUT) are unknown.We used whole-mount immunohistochemistry and histochemical stains to localize neural elements in 15.5 days post coitus (dpc) fetal mice. To identify potential regulatory factors expressed in pelvic ganglia, we surveyed expression patterns for known or probable transcription factors (TF) annotated in the mouse genome by screening a wholemount in situ hybridization library of fetal UGTs. Of the 155 genes detected in pelvic ganglia, 88 encodeTFs based on the presence of predicted DNA-binding domains. Neural crest (NC)-derived progenitors within the LUT were labeled by Sox10, a well-known regulator of NC development. Genes identified were categorized based on patterns of restricted expression in pelvic ganglia, pelvic ganglia and urethral epithelium, or pelvic ganglia and urethral mesenchyme. Gene expression patterns and the distribution of Sox10+, Phox2b+, Hu+, and PGP9.5+ cells within developing ganglia suggest previously unrecognized regional segregation of Sox10+ progenitors and differentiating neurons in early development of pelvic ganglia. Reverse transcription-PCR of pelvic ganglia RNA from fetal and post-natal stages demonstrated that multiple TFs maintain post-natal expression, although Pax3 is extinguished before weaning. Our analysis identifies multiple potential regulatory genes includingTFs that may participate in segregation of discrete lineages within pelvic ganglia. The genes identified here are attractive candidate disease genes that may now be further investigated for their roles in malformation syndromes or in LUT dysfunction. © 2012 Wiese, Ireland, Fleming, Yu, Valerius,Georgas, Chiu, Brennan, Armstrong, Little, McMahon and Southard-Smith.},

   abstract = {A set of 12,779 expressed sequence tags (ESTs), both the 5'-most and 3'-most ends, derived from Ciona intestinalis tadpole larvae was categorized into 3521 independent clusters, from which 1013 clusters corresponding to 9424 clones were randomly selected to analyze genetic information and gene expression profiles. When compared with sequences in databases, 545 of the clusters showed significant matches (P < E-15) with reported proteins, while 153 showed matches with putative proteins for which there is not enough information to categorize their function, and 315 had no significant sequence similarities to known proteins. Sequence-similarity analyses of the 545 clusters in relation to the biological functions demonstrated that 407 of them have functions that many kinds of cells use, 104 are associated with cell-cell communication, and 34 are transcription factors or other gene-regulatory proteins. Sequence prevalence distribution analysis demonstrated that more than one-half of the mRNAs are rare mRNAs. All of the 1013 clusters were subjected to whole-mount in situ hybridization to analyze the gene expression profile in the tadpole larva. A total of 361 clusters showed expression specific to a certain tissue or organ: 96 showed epidermis-specific expression, 60 were specific to the nervous system, 108 to endoderm, 34 to mesenchyme, 5 to trunk lateral cells, 4 to trunk ventral cells, 23 to notochord, 28 to muscle, and 3 to siphon rudiments. In addition, 190 clusters showed expression in multiple tissues. Moreover, nervous system-specific genes showed intriguing expression patterns dependent on the cluster. The present study highlights a broad spectrum of genes that are used in the formation of one of the most primitive chordate body plans as well as for the function of various types of tissue and organ and also provides molecular markers for individual tissues and organs constituting the Ciona larva.},

   abstract = {Although subcellular mRNA trafficking has been demonstrated as a mechanism to control protein distribution, it is generally believed that most protein localization occurs subsequent to translation. To address this point, we developed and employed a high-resolution fluorescent in situ hybridization procedure to comprehensively evaluate mRNA localization dynamics during early Drosophila embryogenesis. Surprisingly, of the 3370 genes analyzed, 71% of those expressed encode subcellularly localized mRNAs. Dozens of new and striking localization patterns were observed, implying an equivalent variety of localization mechanisms. Tight correlations between mRNA distribution and subsequent protein localization and function, indicate major roles for mRNA localization in nucleating localized cellular machineries. A searchable web resource documenting mRNA expression and localization dynamics has been established and will serve as an invaluable tool for dissecting localization mechanisms and for predicting gene functions and interactions. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Background: To model and thoroughly understand animal transcription networks, it is essential to derive accurate spatial and temporal descriptions of developing gene expression patterns with cellular resolution. Results: Here we describe a suite of methods that provide the first quantitative three-dimensional description of gene expression and morphology at cellular resolution in whole embryos. A database containing information derived from 1,282 embryos is released that describes the mRNA expression of 22 genes at multiple time points in the Drosophila blastoderm. We demonstrate that our methods are sufficiently accurate to detect previously undescribed features of morphology and gene expression. The cellular blastoderm is shown to have an intricate morphology of nuclear density patterns and apical/basal displacements that correlate with later well-known morphological features. Pair rule gene expression stripes, generally considered to specify patterning only along the anterior/posterior body axis, are shown to have complex changes in stripe location, stripe curvature, and expression level along the dorsal/ventral axis. Pair rule genes are also found to not always maintain the same register to each other. Conclusion: The application of these quantitative methods to other developmental systems will likely reveal many other previously unknown features and provide a more rigorous understanding of developmental regulatory networks. © 2006 Luengo Hendriks et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {Despite the increasing quality and quantity of genomic sequence that is available to researchers, predicting gene function from sequence information remains a challenge. One method for obtaining rapid insight into potential functional roles of novel genes is through gene expression mapping. We have performed a high throughput whole-mount in situ hybridization (ISH) screen with chick embryos to identify novel, differentially expressed genes. Approximately 1,200 5′ expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were generated from cDNA clones of a Hamburger and Hamilton (HH) stage 4-7 (late gastrula) chick embryo endoderm-mesoderm library. After screening to remove ubiquitously expressed cDNAs and internal clustering and after comparison to GenBank sequences, remaining cDNAs (representing both characterized and uncharacterized genes) were screened for expression in HH stage 3-14 embryos by automated high throughput ISH. Of 786 cDNAs for which ISH was successfully performed, approximately 30% showed ubiquitous expression, 40% were negative, and approximately 30% showed a restricted expression pattern. cDNAs were identified that showed restricted expression in every embryonic region, including the primitive streak, somites, developing cardiovascular system and neural tube/neural crest. A relational database was developed to hold all EST sequences, ISH images, and corresponding BLAST report information, and to enable browsing and querying of data. A user interface is freely accessible at http://geisha.biosci.arizona.edu. Results show that high throughput whole-mount ISH provides an effective approach for identifying novel genes that are differentially expressed in the developing chicken embryo. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

   abstract = {Background: Overlaps in spatial patterns of gene expression are frequently an initial clue to genetic interactions during embryonic development. However, manual inspection of images requires considerable time and resources impeding the discovery of important interactions because tens of thousands of images exist. The FlyExpress discovery platform was developed to facilitate data-driven comparative analysis of expression pattern images from Drosophila embryos. Results: An image-based search of the BDGP and Fly-FISH datasets conducted in FlyExpress yields fewer but more precise results than text-based searching when the specific goal is to find genes with overlapping expression patterns. We also provide an example of a FlyExpress contribution to scientific discovery: an analysis of gene expression patterns for multigene family members revealed that spatial divergence is far more frequent than temporal divergence, especially after the maternal to zygotic transition. This discovery provides a new clue to molecular mechanisms whereby duplicated genes acquire novel functions. Conclusions: The application of FlyExpress to understanding the process by which new genes acquire novel functions is just one of a myriad of ways in which it can contribute to our understanding of developmental and evolutionary biology. This resource has many other potential applications, limited only by the investigator's imagination. copy; 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

This model captures in a common framework the average expression patterns for many genes in spite of significant variation in morphology and expression between individual embryos. We establish the method's accuracy by showing that relationships between a pair of genes' expression inferred from the model are nearly identical to those measured in embryos costained for the pair.

Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.Results: To align our large (&gt;80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of &gt;50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80–90% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.Availability and implementation: STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cortical interneurons originating from the medial ganglionic eminence, MGE, are among the most diverse cells within the CNS. Different pools of proliferating progenitor cells are thought to exist in the ventricular zone of the MGE, but whether the underlying subventricular and mantle regions of the MGE are spatially patterned has not yet been addressed. Here, we combined laser-capture microdissection and multiplex RNA-sequencing to map the transcriptome of MGE cells at a spatial resolution of 50 μm.
RESULTS: Distinct groups of progenitor cells showing different stages of interneuron maturation are identified and topographically mapped based on their genome-wide transcriptional pattern. Although proliferating potential decreased rather abruptly outside the ventricular zone, a ventro-lateral gradient of increasing migratory capacity was identified, revealing heterogeneous cell populations within this neurogenic structure.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that spatially resolved RNA-seq is ideally suited for high resolution topographical mapping of genome-wide gene expression in heterogeneous anatomical structures such as the mammalian central nervous system.},

   abstract = {Site-specific gene expression analyses are important for understanding tissue functions. Despite rapid developments in DNA-related technologies, the site-specific analysis of whole genome expression for a tissue remains challenging. Thus, a new tool is required for capturing multiple tissue micro-dissections or single cells while retaining the positional information. Here, we describe the development of such a system, which can pick up micro-dissections by punching a tissue repeatedly in a very short period, e.g., 5 s/sampling cycle. A photo of the punched tissue provides information on the dissected positions, allowing site-specific gene expression analysis. We demonstrate the site-specific analysis of a frozen tissue slice of mouse brain by analyzing many micro-dissections produced from the tissue at a 300-μm pitch. The site-specific analysis provided new insights into the gene expression profiles in a tissue and on tissue functions. The analysis of site-specific whole genome expression may therefore, open new avenues in life science.},

   abstract = {Development of specialized cells and structures in the heart is regulated by spatially - restricted molecular pathways. Disruptions in these pathways can cause severe congenital cardiac malformations or functional defects. To better understand these pathways and how they regulate cardiac development we used tomo-seq, combining high-throughput RNA-sequencing with tissue- sectioning, to establish a genome-wide expression dataset with high spatial resolution for the developing zebrafish heart. Analysis of the dataset revealed over 1100 genes differentially expressed in sub-compartments. Pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial region induce heart contractions, but little is known about the mechanisms underlying their development. Using our transcriptome map, we identified spatially restricted Wnt/b-catenin signaling activity in pacemaker cells, which was controlled by Islet-1 activity. Moreover, Wnt/b-catenin signaling controls heart rate by regulating pacemaker cellular response to parasympathetic stimuli. Thus, this high-resolution transcriptome map incorporating all cell types in the embryonic heart can expose spatially restricted molecular pathways critical for specific cardiac functions.},

Current methods to correlate a cell’s position with its transcriptome in living tissues have various limitations. We developed an approach, called ‘ZipSeq’, that uses patterned illumination and photocaged oligonucleotides to serially print barcodes (‘zipcodes’) onto live cells in intact tissues, in real time and with an on-the-fly selection of patterns. Using ZipSeq, we mapped gene expression in three settings: in vitro wound healing, live lymph node sections and a live tumor microenvironment. In all cases, we discovered new gene expression patterns associated with histological structures. In the tumor microenvironment, this demonstrated a trajectory of myeloid and T cell differentiation from the periphery inward. A combinatorial variation of ZipSeq efficiently scales in the number of regions defined, providing a pathway for complete mapping of live tissues, subsequent to real-time imaging or perturbation.},

Here we describe the generation and analysis of a transcriptional atlas of the adult human brain, comprising extensive histological analysis and comprehensive microarray profiling of ∼900 neuroanatomically precise subdivisions in two individuals. Transcriptional regulation varies enormously by anatomical location, with different regions and their constituent cell types displaying robust molecular signatures that are highly conserved between individuals. Analysis of differential gene expression and gene co-expression relationships demonstrates that brain-wide variation strongly reflects the distributions of major cell classes such as neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia. Local neighbourhood relationships between fine anatomical subdivisions are associated with discrete neuronal subtypes and genes involved with synaptic transmission. The neocortex displays a relatively homogeneous transcriptional pattern, but with distinct features associated selectively with primary sensorimotor cortices and with enriched frontal lobe expression. Notably, the spatial topography of the neocortex is strongly reflected in its molecular topographythe closer two cortical regions, the more similar their transcriptomes.

However, the extent and importance of mRNA polarization in epithelial tissues are unclear. Here, we used single-molecule transcript imaging and subcellular transcriptomics to uncover global apical-basal intracellular polarization of mRNA in the mouse intestinal epithelium. The localization of mRNAs did not generally overlap protein localization. Instead, ribosomes were more abundant on the apical sides, and apical transcripts were consequently more efficiently translated. Refeeding of fasted mice elicited a basal-to-apical shift in polarization of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins, which was associated with a specific boost in their translation. This led to increased protein production, required for efficient nutrient absorption. These findings reveal a posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism involving dynamic polarization of mRNA and polarized translation.},

Although model organisms have provided much insight into this process, we know very little about gastrulation in humans, owing to the difficulty of obtaining embryos at such early stages of development and the ethical and technical restrictions that limit the feasibility of observing gastrulation ex vivo2. Here we show that human embryonic stem cells can be used to generate gastruloids—three-dimensional multicellular aggregates that differentiate to form derivatives of the three germ layers organized spatiotemporally, without additional extra-embryonic tissues. Human gastruloids undergo elongation along an anteroposterior axis, and we use spatial transcriptomics to show that they exhibit patterned gene expression. This includes a signature of somitogenesis that suggests that 72-h human gastruloids show some features of Carnegie-stage-9 embryos3. Our study represents an experimentally tractable model system to reveal and examine human-specific regulatory processes that occur during axial organization in early development.},

To date, the expression pattern of only a small number of genes in gastruloids has been explored with microscopy, and the extent to which genome-wide expression patterns in gastruloids mimic those in embryos is unclear. Here we compare mouse gastruloids with mouse embryos using single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics. We identify various embryonic cell types that were not previously known to be present in gastruloids, and show that key regulators of somitogenesis are expressed similarly between embryos and gastruloids. Using live imaging, we show that the somitogenesis clock is active in gastruloids and has dynamics that resemble those in vivo. Because gastruloids can be grown in large quantities, we performed a small screen that revealed how reduced FGF signalling induces a short-tail phenotype in embryos. Finally, we demonstrate that embedding in Matrigel induces gastruloids to generate somites with the correct rostral–caudal patterning, which appear sequentially in an anterior-to-posterior direction over time. This study thus shows the power of gastruloids as a model system for exploring development and somitogenesis in vitro in a high-throughput manner.},

The result is a new global log-bilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families in the literature: global matrix factorization and local context window methods. Our model efficiently leverages statistical information by training only on the nonzero elements in a word-word co-occurrence matrix, rather than on the entire sparse matrix or on individual context windows in a large corpus. The model produces a vector space with meaningful sub-structure, as evidenced by its performance of 75% on a recent word analogy task. It also outperforms related models on similarity tasks and named entity recognition.},

Fluorescence microscopy is a powerful quantitative tool for exploring regulatory networks in single cells. However, the number of molecular species that can be measured simultaneously is limited by the spectral overlap between fluorophores. Here we demonstrate a simple but general strategy to drastically increase the capacity for multiplex detection of molecules in single cells by using optical super-resolution microscopy (SRM) and combinatorial labeling. As a proof of principle, we labeled mRNAs with unique combinations of fluorophores using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and resolved the sequences and combinations of fluorophores with SRM. We measured mRNA levels of 32 genes simultaneously in single Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. These experiments demonstrate that combinatorial labeling and super-resolution imaging of single cells is a natural approach to bring systems biology into single cells.},

In addition, it allows extraction of a multivariate feature set quantifying subcellular patterning and spatial properties of transcripts and their cell-to-cell variability. This has multiple implications for the functional interpretation of cell-to-cell variability in gene expression and enables the unbiased identification of functionally relevant in situ signatures of the transcriptome without the need for perturbations.

We identified distinct layers in the dentate gyrus corresponding to the granule cell layer and the subgranular zone and, contrary to previous reports, discovered that distinct subregions within the CA1 and CA3 are composed of unique combinations of cells in different transcriptional states. In addition, we found that the dorsal CA1 is relatively homogeneous at the single cell level, while ventral CA1 is highly heterogeneous. These structures and patterns are observed using different mice and different sets of genes. Together, these results demonstrate the power of seqFISH in transcriptional profiling of complex tissues.},

   abstract = {Multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) allows simultaneous imaging of numerous RNA species in their native cellular environment and hence spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomic measurements. However, the relatively modest brightness of signals from single RNA molecules can become limiting in a number of applications, such as increasing the imaging throughput, imaging shorter RNAs, and imaging samples with high degrees of background, such as some tissue samples. Here, we report a branched DNA (bDNA) amplification approach for MERFISH measurements. This approach produces a drastic signal increase in RNA FISH samples without increasing the fluorescent spot size for individual RNAs or increasing the variation in brightness from spot to spot, properties that are important for MERFISH imaging. Using this amplification approach in combination with MERFISH, we demonstrated RNA imaging and profiling with a near 100% detection efficiency. We further demonstrated that signal amplification improves MERFISH performance when fewer FISH probes are used for each RNA species, which should allow shorter RNAs to be imaged. We anticipate that the combination of bDNA amplification with MERFISH should facilitate many other applications and extend the range of biological questions that can be addressed by this technique in both cell culture and tissues.},

(p. 1360, published online 27 February) developed a method of fluorescent in situ RNA sequencing (FISSEQ) that works in vivo to show messenger RNA localization within cells. The method amplifies complementary DNA targets by rolling circle amplification, and then in situ cross-linking locks amplicons to produce ample, highly localized templates for three-dimensional sequencing. The technique was tested in fibroblasts to reveal the differences between individual cells during wound repair. Understanding the spatial organization of gene expression with single-nucleotide resolution requires localizing the sequences of expressed RNA transcripts within a cell in situ. Here, we describe fluorescent in situ RNA sequencing (FISSEQ), in which stably cross-linked complementary DNA (cDNA) amplicons are sequenced within a biological sample. Using 30-base reads from 8102 genes in situ, we examined RNA expression and localization in human primary fibroblasts with a simulated wound-healing assay. FISSEQ is compatible with tissue sections and whole-mount embryos and reduces the limitations of optical resolution and noisy signals on single-molecule detection. Our platform enables massively parallel detection of genetic elements, including gene transcripts and molecular barcodes, and can be used to investigate cellular phenotype, gene regulation, and environment in situ.},

We therefore named our method In Situ Transcriptome Accessibility sequencing (INSTA-seq). Sequencing reads terminated near 3’ UTR cis-motifs (e.g. Zip48C, stau), revealing RNA-protein interactions. Additionally, Act5C polyadenylation isoforms retaining zipcode motifs were selectively localized to the optical stalk, consistent with their biology.

We further identify candidate RNAs localized to mitochondria-ER junctions and nuclear lamina, two compartments that are recalcitrant to classical biochemical purification.

Here, we demonstrate DNA microscopy, a distinct imaging modality for scalable, optics-free mapping of relative biomolecule positions. In DNA microscopy of transcripts, transcript molecules are tagged in situ with randomized nucleotides, labeling each molecule uniquely. A second in situ reaction then amplifies the tagged molecules, concatenates the resulting copies, and adds new randomized nucleotides to uniquely label each concatenation event. An algorithm decodes molecular proximities from these concatenated sequences and infers physical images of the original transcripts at cellular resolution with precise sequence information. Because its imaging power derives entirely from diffusive molecular dynamics, DNA microscopy constitutes a chemically encoded microscopy system.

   abstract = {Background: Drosophila gene expression pattern images document the spatiotemporal dynamics of gene expression during embryogenesis. A comparative analysis of these images could provide a fundamentally important way for studying the regulatory networks governing development. To facilitate pattern comparison and searching, groups of images in the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP) high-throughput study were annotated with a variable number of anatomical terms manually using a controlled vocabulary. Considering that the number of available images is rapidly increasing, it is imperative to design computational methods to automate this task. Results: We present a computational method to annotate gene expression pattern images automatically. The proposed method uses the bag-of-words scheme to utilize the existing information on pattern annotation and annotates images using a model that exploits correlations among terms. The proposed method can annotate images individually or in groups (e.g., according to the developmental stage). In addition, the proposed method can integrate information from different two-dimensional views of embryos. Results on embryonic patterns from BDGP data demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms other methods. Conclusion: The proposed bag-of-words scheme is effective in representing a set of annotations assigned to a group of images, and the model employed to annotate images successfully captures the correlations among different controlled vocabulary terms. The integration of existing annotation information from multiple embryonic views improves annotation performance. © 2009 Ji et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {Advances in reporters for gene expression have made it possible to document and quantify expression patterns in 2D-4D. In contrast to microarrays, which provide data for many genes but averaged and/or at low resolution, images reveal the high spatial dynamics of gene expression. Developing computational methods to compare, annotate, and model gene expression based on images is imperative, considering that available data are rapidly increasing. We have developed a sparse Bayesian factor analysis model in which the observed expression diversity of among a large set of high-dimensional images is modeled by a small number of hidden common factors. We apply this approach on embryonic expression patterns from a Drosophila RNA in situ image database, and show that the automatically inferred factors provide for a meaningful decomposition and represent common co-regulation or biological functions. The low-dimensional set of factor mixing weights is further used as features by a classifier to annotate expression patterns with functional categories. On human-curated annotations, our sparse approach reaches similar or better classification of expression patterns at different developmental stages, when compared to other automatic image annotation methods using thousands of hard-to-interpret features. Our study therefore outlines a general framework for large microscopy data sets, in which both the generative model itself, as well as its application for analysis tasks such as automated annotation, can provide insight into biological questions. © 2011 Pruteanu-Malinici et al.},

The ISH (in-situ-hybridization)-based gene expression micro-imaging technology offers an effective approach to perform large-scale spatial-temporal profiling of whole-body mRNA abundance. However, analytical tools for discovering gene interactions from such data remain an open challenge due to various reasons, including difficulties in extracting canonical representations of gene activities from images, and in inference of statistically meaningful networks from such representations. In this paper, we present GINI, a machine learning system for inferring gene interaction networks from Drosophila embryonic ISH images. GINI builds on a computer-vision-inspired vector-space representation of the spatial pattern of gene expression in ISH images, enabled by our recently developed SPEX2 system; and a new multi-instance-kernel algorithm that learns a sparse Markov network model, in which, every gene (i.e., node) in the network is represented by a vector-valued spatial pattern rather than a scalar-valued gene intensity as in conventional approaches such as a Gaussian graphical model. By capturing the notion of spatial similarity of gene expression, and at the same time properly taking into account the presence of multiple images per gene via multi-instance kernels, GINI is well-positioned to infer statistically sound, and biologically meaningful gene interaction networks from image data. Using both synthetic data and a small manually curated data set, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in network building. Furthermore, we report results on a large publicly available collection of Drosophila embryonic ISH images from the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project, where GINI makes novel and interesting predictions of gene interactions.

   abstract = {Allen Brain Atlas (ABA) provides a valuable resource of spatial/temporal gene expressions in mammalian brains. Despite rich information extracted from this database, current analyses suffer from several limitations. First, most studies are either gene-centric or region-centric, thus are inadequate to capture the superposition of multiple spatial-temporal patterns. Second, standard tools of expression analysis such as matrix factorization can capture those patterns but do not explicitly incorporate spatial dependency. To overcome those limitations, we proposed a computational method to detect recurrent patterns in the spatial-temporal gene expression data of developing mouse brains. We demonstrated that regional distinction in brain development could be revealed by localized gene expression patterns. The patterns expressed in the forebrain, medullary and pontomedullary, and basal ganglia are enriched with genes involved in forebrain development, locomotory behavior, and dopamine metabolism respectively. In addition, the timing of global gene expression patterns reflects the general trends of molecular events in mouse brain development. Furthermore, we validated functional implications of the inferred patterns by showing genes sharing similar spatial-temporal expression patterns with Lhx2 exhibited differential expression in the embryonic forebrains of Lhx2 mutant mice. These analysis outcomes confirm the utility of recurrent expression patterns in studying brain development.},

   abstract = {Spatial gene expression patterns enable the detection of local covariability and are extremely useful for identifying local gene interactions during normal development. The abundance of spatial expression data in recent years has led to the modeling and analysis of regulatory networks. The inherent complexity of such data makes it a challenge to extract biological information. We developed staNMF, a method that combines a scalable implementation of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with a new stability-driven model selection criterion. When applied to a set of Drosophila early embryonic spatial gene expression images, one of the largest datasets of its kind, staNMF identified 21 principal patterns (PP). Providing a compact yet biologically interpretable representation of Drosophila expression patterns, PP are comparable to a fate map generated experimentally by laser ablation and show exceptional promise as a data-driven alternative to manual annotations. Our analysis mapped genes to cell-fate programs and assigned putative biological roles to uncharacterized genes. Finally, we used the PP to generate local transcription factor regulatory networks. Spatially local correlation networks were constructed for six PP that span along the embryonic anterior–posterior axis. Using a two-tail 5% cutoff on correlation, we reproduced 10 of the 11 links in the well-studied gap gene network. The performance of PP with the Drosophila data suggests that staNMF provides informative decompositions and constitutes a useful computational lens through which to extract biological insight from complex and often noisy gene expression data.},

Methods for capturing these spatial and/or temporal expression patterns include in situ hybridization or fluorescent reporter constructs or tags, and results are still frequently assessed by subjective qualitative comparisons. In order to deal with available large datasets, fully automated analysis methods must be developed to properly normalize and model spatial expression patterns.Results: We have developed image segmentation and registration methods to identify and extract spatial gene expression patterns from RNA in situ hybridization experiments of Drosophila embryos. These methods allow us to normalize and extract expression information for 78 621 images from 3724 genes across six time stages. The similarity between gene expression patterns is computed using four scoring metrics: mean squared error, Haar wavelet distance, mutual information and spatial mutual information (SMI). We additionally propose a strategy to calculate the significance of the similarity between two expression images, by generating surrogate datasets with similar spatial expression patterns using a Monte Carlo swap sampler. On data from an early development time stage, we show that SMI provides the most biologically relevant metric of comparison, and that our significance testing generalizes metrics to achieve similar performance. We exemplify the application of spatial metrics on the well-known Drosophila segmentation network.Availability: A Java webstart application to register and compare patterns, as well as all source code, are available from: http://tools.genome.duke.edu/generegulation/image_analysis/insituContact:uwe.ohler@duke.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Currently, investigators must visually inspect numerous images containing embryonic expression patterns to identify spatially similar patterns for inferring potential genetic interactions. The lack of a computational approach to identify pattern similarities is an impediment to advancement in developmental biology research because of the rapidly increasing amount of available embryonic gene expression data. Therefore, we have developed computational approaches to automate the comparison of gene expression patterns contained in images of early stage Drosophila melanogaster embryos (prior to the beginning of germ-band elongation); similarities and differences in gene expression patterns in these early stages have extensive developmental effects. Here we describe a basic expression search tool (BEST) to retrieve best matching expression patterns for a given query expression pattern and a computational device for gene interaction inference using gene expression pattern images and information on the associated genotypes and probes. Analysis of a prototype collection of Drosophila gene expression pattern images is presented to demonstrate the utility of these methods in identifying biologically meaningful matches and inferring gene interactions by direct image content analysis. In particular, the use of BEST searches for gene expression patterns is akin to that of BLAST searches for finding similar sequences. These computational developmental biology methodologies are likely to make the great wealth of embryonic gene expression pattern data easily accessible and to accelerate the discovery of developmental networks.},

The use of high-throughput approaches, such as large-scale in situ hybridisation and genome-wide expression profiling via DNA microarrays, is beginning to provide insights into the complexities of development. However, in many organisms the collection and annotation of comprehensive in situ localisation data is a difficult and time-consuming task. Here, we present a widely applicable computational approach, integrating developmental time-course microarray data with annotated in situ hybridisation studies, that facilitates the de novo prediction of tissue-specific expression for genes that have no in vivo gene expression localisation data available. Using a classification approach, trained with data from microarray and in situ hybridisation studies of gene expression during Drosophila embryonic development, we made a set of predictions on the tissue-specific expression of Drosophila genes that have not been systematically characterised by in situ hybridisation experiments. The reliability of our predictions is confirmed by literature-derived annotations in FlyBase, by overrepresentation of Gene Ontology biological process annotations, and, in a selected set, by detailed gene-specific studies from the literature. Our novel organism-independent method will be of considerable utility in enriching the annotation of gene function and expression in complex multicellular organisms. © 2007 Samsonova et al.},

Interestingly, the five GOs contain 20 genes, most of which are related to differentiation and morphogenesis, such as activin A receptor and Wnt family member genes. Further analysis indicated that Id2 is the most influential gene contributing to the reconstruction. SPRESSO may provide novel and better insights on the mechanisms of 3D structure formation of living tissues via informative genes playing a role as spatial discriminators.},

   abstract = {Multiplexed RNA sequencing in individual cells is transforming basic and clinical life sciences1–4. Often, however, tissues must first be dissociated, and crucial information about spatial relationships and communication between cells is thus lost. Existing approaches to reconstruct tissues assign spatial positions to each cell, independently of other cells, by using spatial patterns of expression of marker genes5,6—which often do not exist. Here we reconstruct spatial positions with little or no prior knowledge, by searching for spatial arrangements of sequenced cells in which nearby cells have transcriptional profiles that are often (but not always) more similar than cells that are farther apart. We formulate this task as a generalized optimal-transport problem for probabilistic embedding and derive an efficient iterative algorithm to solve it. We reconstruct the spatial expression of genes in mammalian liver and intestinal epithelium, fly and zebrafish embryos, sections from the mammalian cerebellum and whole kidney, and use the reconstructed tissues to identify genes that are spatially informative. Thus, we identify an organization principle for the spatial expression of genes in animal tissues, which can be exploited to infer meaningful probabilities of spatial position for individual cells. Our framework (‘novoSpaRc’) can incorporate prior spatial information and is compatible with any single-cell technology. Additional principles that underlie the cartography of gene expression can be tested using our approach.},

Manifold alignment is a principled, effective tool for integrating multiple data sets and controlling for confounding factors. We demonstrate that the semi-supervised t-distributed Gaussian process latent variable model (sstGPLVM), which projects the data onto a mixture of fixed and latent dimensions, can learn a unified low-dimensional embedding for multiple single cell experiments with minimal assumptions. We show the efficacy of the model as compared with state-of-the-art methods for single cell data integration on simulated data, pancreas cells from four sequencing technologies, induced pluripotent stem cells from male and female donors, and mouse brain cells from both spatial seqFISH+ and traditional scRNA-seq.

   abstract = {Spatial studies of transcriptome provide biologists with gene expression maps of heterogeneous and complex tissues. However, most experimental protocols for spatial transcriptomics suffer from the need to select beforehand a small fraction of genes to be quantified over the entire transcriptome. Standard single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is more prevalent, easier to implement and can in principle capture any gene but cannot recover the spatial location of the cells. In this manuscript, we focus on the problem of imputation of missing genes in spatial transcriptomic data based on (unpaired) standard scRNA-seq data from the same biological tissue. Building upon domain adaptation work, we propose gimVI, a deep generative model for the integration of spatial transcriptomic data and scRNA-seq data that can be used to impute missing genes. After describing our generative model and an inference procedure for it, we compare gimVI to alternative methods from computational biology or domain adaptation on real datasets and outperform Seurat Anchors, Liger and CORAL to impute held-out genes.},

With the recent launch of the 10x Genomics Visium platform, such methods have started to become widely adopted. The experimental protocol is conducted on individual tissue sections collected from a larger tissue sample. The two-dimensional nature of this data requires multiple consecutive sections to be collected from the sample in order to construct a comprehensive three-dimensional map of the tissue. However, there is currently no software available that lets the user process the images, align stacked experiments, and finally visualize them together in 3D to create a holistic view of the tissue. RESULTS: We have developed an R package named STUtility that takes 10x Genomics Visium data as input and provides features to perform standardized data transformations, alignment of multiple tissue sections, regional annotation, and visualizations of the combined data in a 3D model framework. CONCLUSIONS: STUtility lets the user process, analyze and visualize multiple samples of spatially resolved RNA sequencing and image data from the 10x Genomics Visium platform.

We identified over 100 genes, including known breast cancer biomarkers of intratumoral heterogeneity and the co-localization of tumour growth and immune activation, the expression of which can be predicted from the histopathology images at a resolution of 100 µm.

In particular, spatially resolved gene expression profiles are key to understand tissue organization and function. However, spatial transcriptomics (ST) profiling techniques lack single-cell resolution and require a combination with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) information to deconvolute the spatially indexed datasets. Leveraging the strengths of both data types, we developed SPOTlight, a computational tool that enables the integration of ST with scRNA-seq data to infer the location of cell types and states within a complex tissue. SPOTlight is centered around a seeded non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) regression, initialized using cell-type marker genes, and non-negative least squares (NNLS) to subsequently deconvolute ST capture locations (spots). Using synthetic spots, simulating varying reference quantities and qualities, we confirmed high prediction accuracy also with shallowly sequenced or small-sized scRNA-seq reference datasets. We trained the NMF regression model with sample-matched or external datasets, resulting in accurate and sensitive spatial predictions. SPOTlight deconvolution of the mouse brain correctly mapped subtle neuronal cell states of the cortical layers and the defined architecture of the hippocampus. In human pancreatic cancer, we successfully segmented patient sections into healthy and cancerous areas, and further fine-mapped normal and neoplastic cell states. Trained on an external pancreatic tumor immune reference, we charted the localization of clinical-relevant and tumor-specific immune cell states. Using SPOTlight to detect regional enrichment of immune cells and their co-localization with tumor and adjacent stroma provides an illustrative example in its flexible application spectrum and future potential in digital pathology. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

   abstract = {Complex tissues, such as the brain, are composed of multiple different cell types, each of which have distinct and important roles, for example in neural function. Moreover, it has recently been appreciated that the cells that make up these sub-cell types themselves harbour significant cell-to-cell heterogeneity, in particular at the level of gene expression. The ability to study this heterogeneity has been revolutionised by advances in experimental technology, such as Wholemount in Situ Hybridizations (WiSH) and single-cell RNA-sequencing. Consequently, it is now possible to study gene expression levels in thousands of cells from the same tissue type. After generating such data one of the key goals is to cluster the cells into groups that correspond to both known and putatively novel cell types. Whilst many clustering algorithms exist, they are typically unable to incorporate information about the spatial dependence between cells within the tissue under study. When such information exists it provides important insights that should be directly included in the clustering scheme. To this end we have developed a clustering method that uses a Hidden Markov Random Field (HMRF) model to exploit both quantitative measures of expression and spatial information. To accurately reflect the underlying biology, we extend current HMRF approaches by allowing the degree of spatial coherency to differ between clusters. We demonstrate the utility of our method using simulated data before applying it to cluster single cell gene expression data generated by applying WiSH to study expression patterns in the brain of the marine annelid Platynereis dumereilii. Our approach allows known cell types to be identified as well as revealing new, previously unexplored cell types within the brain of this important model system.},

   abstract = {Spatial transcriptomic technologies measure gene expression at increasing spatial resolution, approaching individual cells. However, a limitation of current technologies is that spatial measurements may contain contributions from multiple cells, hindering the discovery of cell type-specific spatial patterns of localization and expression. Here, we develop Robust Cell Type Decomposition (RCTD, https://github.com/dmcable/RCTD), a computational method that leverages cell type profiles learned from single-cell RNA sequencing data to decompose mixtures, such as those observed in spatial transcriptomic technologies. Our approach accounts for platform effects introduced by systematic technical variability inherent to different sequencing modalities. We demonstrate RCTD provides substantial improvement in cell type assignment in Slide-seq data by accurately reproducing known cell type and subtype localization patterns in the cerebellum and hippocampus. We further show the advantages of RCTD by its ability to detect mixtures and identify cell types on an assessment dataset. Finally, we show how RCTD's recovery of cell type localization uniquely enables the discovery of genes within a cell type whose expression depends on spatial environment. Spatial mapping of cell types with RCTD has the potential to enable the definition of spatial components of cellular identity, uncovering new principles of cellular organization in biological tissue.

With convolved negative binomial regression we discover patterns which correspond to cell types, microenvironments, or tissue components, and that consist of gene expression profiles and spatial activity maps. Expression profiles quantify how strongly each gene is expressed in a given pattern, and spatial activity maps reflect where in space each pattern is active. Arbitrary covariates and prior hierarchies are supported to leverage complex experimental designs. We demonstrate the method with Spatial Transcriptomics data of mouse brain and olfactory bulb. The discovered transcriptomic patterns correspond to neuroanatomically distinct cell layers. Moreover, batch effects are successfully addressed, leading to consistent pattern inference for multi-sample analyses. On this basis, we identify known and uncharacterized genes that are spatially differentially expressed in the hippocampal field between Ammon's horn and the dentate gyrus.},

   abstract = {Liver zonation, the spatial separation of the immense spectrum of different metabolic pathways along the liver sinusoids, is fundamental for proper functioning of this organ. Recent progress in elucidating localization and interactions of different metabolic pathways by using "omics" techniques and novel approaches to couple them with refined spatial resolution and in characterizing novel master regulators of zonation by using transgenic mice has created the basis for a deeper understanding of core mechanisms of zonation and their impact on liver physiology, pathology and metabolic diseases. This review summarizes the fascinating technical achievements for investigating liver zonation and the elucidation of an emerging network of master regulators of zonation that keep the plethora of interrelated and sometimes opposing functions of the liver in balance with nutritional supply and specific requirements of the entire body. In addition, a brief overview is given on newly described zonated functions and novel details on how diverse the segmentation of metabolic zonation may be. From these facts and developments a few fundamental principles are inferred which seem to rule zonation of liver parenchyma. In addition, we identify important questions that still need to be answered as well as interesting fields of research such as the connection of zonation with circadian rhythm and gender dimorphism which need to be pushed further, in order to improve our understanding of metabolic zonation. Finally, an outlook is given on how disturbance of liver zonation and its regulation may impact on liver pathology and the development of metabolic diseases.},

Capturing the spatial proteome — that is, the localizations of proteins and their dynamics at the subcellular level — is therefore essential for a complete understanding of cell biology. Owing to substantial advances in microscopy, mass spectrometry and machine learning applications for data analysis, the field is now mature for proteome-wide investigations of spatial cellular regulation. Studies of the human proteome have begun to reveal a complex architecture, including single-cell variations, dynamic protein translocations, changing interaction networks and proteins localizing to multiple compartments. Furthermore, several studies have successfully harnessed the power of comparative spatial proteomics as a discovery tool to unravel disease mechanisms. We are at the beginning of an era in which spatial proteomics finally integrates with cell biology and medical research, thereby paving the way for unbiased systems-level insights into cellular processes. Here, we discuss current methods for spatial proteomics using imaging or mass spectrometry and specifically highlight global comparative applications.

Here we measure the entire transcriptome of thousands of mouse liver cells and infer their lobule coordinates on the basis of a panel of zonated landmark genes, characterized with single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization. Using this approach, we obtain the zonation profiles of all liver genes with high spatial resolution. We find that around 50% of liver genes are significantly zonated and uncover abundant non-monotonic profiles that peak at the mid-lobule layers. These include a spatial order of bile acid biosynthesis enzymes that matches their position in the enzymatic cascade. Our approach can facilitate the reconstruction of similar spatial genomic blueprints for other mammalian organs.},

Enterocytes perform the diverse tasks of absorbing a wide range of nutrients while protecting the body from the harsh bacterium-rich environment.

Here, we extracted a large panel of landmark genes characterized by transcriptomics of laser capture microdissected villus segments and utilized it for single-cell spatial reconstruction, uncovering broad zonation of enterocyte function along the villus. We found that enterocytes at villus bottoms express an anti-bacterial gene program in a microbiome-dependent manner. They next shift to sequential expression of carbohydrates, peptides, and fat absorption machineries in distinct villus compartments. Finally, they induce a Cd73 immune-modulatory program at the villus tips. Our approach can be used to uncover zonation patterns in other organs when prior knowledge of landmark genes is lacking.

   abstract = {Laser capture microscopy (LCM) coupled with global transcriptome profiling could enable precise analyses of cell populations without the need for tissue dissociation, but has so far required relatively large numbers of cells. Here we report a robust and highly efficient strategy for LCM coupled with full-length mRNA-sequencing (LCM-seq) developed for single-cell transcriptomics. Fixed cells are subjected to direct lysis without RNA extraction, which both simplifies the experimental procedures as well as lowers technical noise. We apply LCM-seq on neurons isolated from mouse tissues, human post-mortem tissues, and illustrate its utility down to single captured cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that LCM-seq can provide biological insight on highly similar neuronal populations, including motor neurons isolated from different levels of the mouse spinal cord, as well as human midbrain dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra compacta and the ventral tegmental area.},

Here, we combine single-cell and spatially resolved transcriptomics to systematically map the molecular, cellular and spatial composition of distinct bone marrow niches. This allowed us to transcriptionally profile all major bone-marrow-resident cell types, determine their localization and clarify sources of pro-haematopoietic factors. Our data demonstrate that Cxcl12-abundant-reticular (CAR) cell subsets (Adipo-CAR and Osteo-CAR) differentially localize to sinusoidal and arteriolar surfaces, act locally as ‘professional cytokine-secreting cells’ and thereby establish peri-vascular micro-niches. Importantly, the three-dimensional bone-marrow organization can be accurately inferred from single-cell transcriptome data using the RNA-Magnet algorithm described here. Together, our study reveals the cellular and spatial organization of bone marrow niches and offers a systematic approach to dissect the complex organization of whole organs.},

We uncover a radial organization of the nuclear transcriptome, which is gated at the inner surface of the nuclear pore for cytoplasmic export of processed transcripts. We identify two distinct pathways of messenger RNA localization to mitochondria, each associated with specific sets of transcripts for building complementary macromolecular machines within the organelle. APEX-seq should be widely applicable to many systems, enabling comprehensive investigations of the spatial transcriptome. A newly developed technique reveals the subcellular transcriptomes at many landmarks in the nucleus and cytosol and connects mRNA localization to genome architecture, protein location, and local-translation mechanisms.},

Due to lack of reliable techniques to perform transcriptional profiling in intact tissues, it remains controversial whether the neural crest is a heterogeneous or homogeneous population. By coupling multiplex single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization with machine learning algorithm based cell segmentation, we examine expression of 35 genes at single cell resolution in vivo. Unbiased hierarchical clustering reveals five spatially distinct subpopulations within the chick dorsal neural tube. Here we identify a neural crest stem cell niche that centers around the dorsal midline with high expression of neural crest genes, pluripotency factors, and lineage markers. Interestingly, neural and neural crest stem cells express distinct pluripotency signatures. This Spatial Genomic Analysis toolkit provides a straightforward approach to study quantitative multiplex gene expression in numerous biological systems, while offering insights into gene regulatory networks via synexpression analysis.},

Screening 46 candidate genes for astrocyte diversity across the mouse cortex, we identified superficial, mid and deep astrocyte identities in gradient layer patterns that were distinct from those of neurons. Astrocyte layer features, established in the early postnatal cortex, mostly persisted in adult mouse and human cortex. Single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial reconstruction analysis further confirmed the presence of astrocyte layers in the adult cortex. Satb2 and Reeler mutations that shifted neuronal post-mitotic development were sufficient to alter glial layering, indicating an instructive role for neuronal cues. Finally, astrocyte layer patterns diverged between mouse cortical regions. These findings indicate that excitatory neurons and astrocytes are organized into distinct lineage-associated laminae.},

However, determining zonation of small cells with low mRNA content, or without highly expressed landmark genes, remains challenging. Here we used paired-cell sequencing, in which mRNA from pairs of attached mouse cells were sequenced and gene expression from one cell type was used to infer the pairs’ tissue coordinates. We applied this method to pairs of hepatocytes and liver endothelial cells (LECs). Using the spatial information from hepatocytes, we reconstructed LEC zonation and extracted a landmark gene panel that we used to spatially map LEC scRNAseq data. Our approach revealed the expression of both Wnt ligands and the Dkk3 Wnt antagonist in distinct pericentral LEC sub-populations. This approach can be used to reconstruct spatial expression maps of non-parenchymal cells in other tissues.},

   abstract = {Gene expression profiles of thousands of genes can now be examined en masse through cDNA and oligonucleotide microar-rays 1-3. Recently, studies have been reported that examined gene expression changes in yeast 4,5 , as well as in mammalian cell lines 6 , primary cells 7 and tissues 8. However, present applications of microarray technology do not include the study of gene expression from individual cell types residing in a given tissue/organ (that is, in situ). Such studies would greatly facilitate our understanding of the complex interactions that exist in vivo between neighboring cell types in normal and disease states. We demonstrate here that gene expression profiles from adjacent cell types can be successfully obtained by integrating the technologies of laser capture microdissection 9 (LCM) and T7-based RNA amplification 10 with cDNA microarrays 11. Neighboring small and large neurons are individually captured To demonstrate this integration of technologies, we examined the differential gene expression between large-and small-sized neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). In general, large DRG neurons are myelinated, fast-conducting and transmit mechanosensory information, whereas small neurons are un-myelinated, slow-conducting and transmit nociceptive information 12. We chose this system because numerous differentially expressed genes (small versus large) have been reported, thus the success of this experiment could be assessed; and because many small and large neurons are adjacent to each other, thus we could test whether individual neurons can be cleanly captured. Large (diameter of >40 µm) and small (diameter <25 µm and with identified nuclei) neurons were cleanly and individually captured by LCM from sections (10 µm in thickness) of Nissl-stained rat DRG (Fig. 1). For this study, two sets of 1,000 large neurons and three sets of 1,000 small neurons were captured for cDNA microarray analysis. RNA amplification is reproducible between individual captures RNA was extracted from each set of neurons and linearly amplified (independently) an estimated 10 6-fold using T7 RNA poly-merase. After being amplified, one fluorescently labeled probe was synthesized from an individually amplified RNA (aRNA), divided equally into three parts and hybridized in triplicate to a microarray ('chip') containing 477 cDNAs (see Methods for chip design) plus 30 cDNAs encoding plant genes (for the determination of non-specific nucleic acid hybridization). Expression in each neuronal set (called S1, S2 and S3 for small and L1 and L2 for large neurons) was thus monitored in triplicate, requiring a total of 15 microarrays. The quality of the microarray data is demonstrated by pseudocolor arrays, one resulting from hy-bridization to probes derived from neuronal set S1 and the other from neuronal set L1 (Fig. 2a). In Fig. 2a, the enlarged part of the chip shows some differences in fluorescence intensity (that is, expression levels) for particular cDNAs and demonstrates that spots containing the different cDNAs are relatively uniform in size and that background between spots is relatively low. To determine whether a signal corresponding to a particular cDNA is reproducible between different chips, we calculated the coefficient of variation [c.v. or (standard deviation/mean) × 100%] for each neuronal set. From these values, the overall average c.v. for all 477 cDNAs per neuronal set was calculated to be: 15.81%, 16.93% and 17.75% for S1, S2 and S3, respectively, and 20.17% and 19.55% for L1 and L2, respectively. Independent amplifications (about 10 6-fold) of different sets of the same neuronal subtype yielded quite similar expression patterns. For example, the correlation of signal intensities between S1 and S2 was R 2 = 0.9688, and between S1 and S3 was R 2 = 0.9399 (Fig. 2b). Similar results were obtained for the two sets of Fig. 1 Laser capture microdissection from Nissl-stained sections (10 µm in thickness) of adult rat large and small DRG neurons. Red arrows indicate DRG neurons to be captured (top panels). The middle and bottom panels show successful capture and film transfer, respectively. Scale bar represents 200 µm.},

   abstract = {The mammalian nervous system executes complex behaviors controlled by specialized, precisely positioned, and interacting cell types. Here, we used RNA sequencing of half a million single cells to create a detailed census of cell types in the mouse nervous system. We mapped cell types spatially and derived a hierarchical, data-driven taxonomy. Neurons were the most diverse and were grouped by developmental anatomical units and by the expression of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Neuronal diversity was driven by genes encoding cell identity, synaptic connectivity, neurotransmission, and membrane conductance. We discovered seven distinct, regionally restricted astrocyte types that obeyed developmental boundaries and correlated with the spatial distribution of key glutamate and glycine neurotransmitters. In contrast, oligodendrocytes showed a loss of regional identity followed by a secondary diversification. The resource presented here lays a solid foundation for understanding the molecular architecture of the mammalian nervous system and enables genetic manipulation of specific cell types. Single-cell transcriptional profiling of the adult mouse nervous system uncovers new cell classes and types across regions, providing a clearer picture of cell diversity by region and a reference atlas for studying the mammalian nervous system.},

   abstract = {Although complex inflammatory-like alterations are observed around the amyloid plaques of Alzheimer's disease (AD), little is known about the molecular changes and cellular interactions that characterize this response. We investigate here, in an AD mouse model, the transcriptional changes occurring in tissue domains in a 100-μm diameter around amyloid plaques using spatial transcriptomics. We demonstrate early alterations in a gene co-expression network enriched for myelin and oligodendrocyte genes (OLIGs), whereas a multicellular gene co-expression network of plaque-induced genes (PIGs) involving the complement system, oxidative stress, lysosomes, and inflammation is prominent in the later phase of the disease. We confirm the majority of the observed alterations at the cellular level using in situ sequencing on mouse and human brain sections. Genome-wide spatial transcriptomics analysis provides an unprecedented approach to untangle the dysregulated cellular network in the vicinity of pathogenic hallmarks of AD and other brain diseases.},

   abstract = {Brain maps are essential for integrating information and interpreting the structure-function relationship of circuits and behavior. We aimed to generate a systematic classification of the adult mouse brain based purely on the unbiased identification of spatially defining features by employing whole-brain spatial transcriptomics. We found that the molecular information was sufficient to deduce the complex and detailed neuroanatomical organization of the brain. The unsupervised (non-expert, data-driven) classification revealed new area- and layer-specific subregions, for example in isocortex and hippocampus, and new subdivisions of striatum. The molecular atlas further supports the characterization of the spatial identity of neurons from their single-cell RNA profile, and provides a resource for annotating the brain using a minimal gene set—a brain palette. In summary, we have established a molecular atlas to formally define the spatial organization of brain regions, including the molecular code for mapping and targeting of discrete neuroanatomical domains.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cell-fate specification and tissue differentiation during development are largely achieved by the regulation of gene transcription. RESULTS: As a first step to creating a comprehensive atlas of gene-expression patterns during Drosophila embryogenesis, we examined 2,179 genes by in situ hybridization to fixed Drosophila embryos. Of the genes assayed, 63.7% displayed dynamic expression patterns that were documented with 25,690 digital photomicrographs of individual embryos. The photomicrographs were annotated using controlled vocabularies for anatomical structures that are organized into a developmental hierarchy. We also generated a detailed time course of gene expression during embryogenesis using microarrays to provide an independent corroboration of the in situ hybridization results. All image, annotation and microarray data are stored in publicly available database. We found that the RNA transcripts of about 1% of genes show clear subcellular localization. Nearly all the annotated expression patterns are distinct. We present an approach for organizing the data by hierarchical clustering of annotation terms that allows us to group tissues that express similar sets of genes as well as genes displaying similar expression patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Analyzing gene-expression patterns by in situ hybridization to whole-mount embryos provides an extremely rich dataset that can be used to identify genes involved in developmental processes that have been missed by traditional genetic analysis. Systematic analysis of rigorously annotated patterns of gene expression will complement and extend the types of analyses carried out using expression microarrays.},

   abstract = {A set of 3423 expressed sequence tags derived from the Ciona intestinalis tailbud embryos was categorized into 1213 independent clusters. When compared with DNA Data Bank of Japan database, 502 clusters of them showed significant matches to reported proteins with distinct function, whereas 184 lacked sufficient information to be categorized (including reported proteins with undefined function) and 527 had no significant similarities to known proteins. Sequence similarity analyses of the 502 clusters in relation to the biosynthetic function, as well as the structure of the message population at this stage, demonstrated that 390 of them were associated with functions that many kinds of cells use, 85 with cell-cell communication and 27 with transcription factors and other gene regulatory proteins. All of the 1213 clusters were subjected to whole-mount in situ hybridization to analyze the gene expression profiles at this stage. A total of 387 clusters showed expression specific to a certain tissue or organ; 149 showed epidermis-specific expression; 34 were specific to the nervous system; 29 to endoderm; 112 to mesenchyme; 32 to notochord; and 31 to muscle. Many genes were also specifically expressed in multiple tissues. The study also highlighted characteristic gene expression profiles dependent on the tissues. In addition, several genes showed intriguing expression patterns that have not been reported previously; for example, four genes were expressed specifically in the nerve cord cells and one gene was expressed only in the posterior part of muscle cells. This study provides molecular markers for each of the tissues and/or organs that constitutes the Ciona tailbud embryo. The sequence information will also be used for further genome scientific approach to explore molecular mechanisms involved in the formation of one of the most primitive chordate body plans.},

   abstract = {The Gene Expression Management System (GEMS) is a database system for patterns of gene expression. These patterns result from systematic whole-mount fluorescent in situ hybridization studies on zebrafish embryos. GEMS is an integrative platform that addresses one of the important challenges of developmental biology: how to integrate genetic data that underpin morphological changes during embryogenesis. Our motivation to build this system was by the need to be able to organize and compare multiple patterns of gene expression at tissue level. Integration with other developmental and biomolecular databases will further support our understanding of development. The GEMS operates in concert with a database containing a digital atlas of zebrafish embryo; this digital atlas of zebrafish development has been conceived prior to the expansion of the GEMS. The atlas contains 3D volume models of canonical stages of zebrafish development in which in each volume model element is annotated with an anatomical term. These terms are extracted from a formal anatomical ontology, i.e. the Developmental Anatomy Ontology of Zebrafish (DAOZ). In the GEMS, anatomical terms from this ontology together with terms from the Gene Ontology (GO) are also used to annotate patterns of gene expression and in this manner providing mechanisms for integration and retrieval . The annotations are the glue for integration of patterns of gene expression in GEMS as well as in other biomolecular databases. At the one hand, zebrafish anatomy terminology allows gene expression data within GEMS to be integrated with phenotypical data in the 3D atlas of zebrafish development. At the other hand, GO terms extend GEMS expression patterns integration to a wide range of bioinformatics resources.},

We implemented medium-throughput RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) for 39 genes mainly corresponding to cell wall proteins for which we have particular interest, selected (i) on their sequence identity (24 class III peroxidase multigenic family members and 15 additional genes used as positive controls) and (ii) on their expression levels in a publicly available Arabidopsis thaliana seed tissue-specific transcriptomics study. The specificity of the hybridization signals was carefully studied, and ISH results obtained for the 39 selected genes were systematically compared with tissue-specific transcriptomics for 5 seed developmental stages. Integration of results illustrates the complementarity of both datasets. The tissue-specific transcriptomics provides high-throughput possibilities whereas ISH provides high spatial resolution. Moreover, depending on the tissues and the developmental stages considered, one or the other technique appears more sensitive than the other. For each tissue/developmental stage, we finally determined tissue-specific transcriptomic threshold values compatible with the spatiotemporally-specific detection limits of ISH for lists of hundreds to tens-of-thousands of genes.},

The lung is a complex organ with lengthy development time driven by interactive gene networks and dynamic cross talk among multiple cell types to control and coordinate lineage specification, cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, morphogenesis, and injury repair. A better understanding of the processes that regulate lung development, particularly alveologenesis, will have a significant impact on survival rates for premature infants born with incomplete lung development and will facilitate lung injury repair and regeneration in adults. A consortium of four research centers, a data coordinating center, and a human tissue repository provides high-quality molecular data of developing human and mouse lungs. LungMAP includes mouse and human data for cross correlation of developmental processes across species. LungMAP is generating foundational data and analysis, creating a web portal for presentation of results and public sharing of data sets, establishing a repository of young human lung tissues obtained through organ donor organizations, and developing a comprehensive lung ontology that incorporates the latest findings of the consortium. The LungMAP website ( www.lungmap.net ) currently contains more than 6,000 high-resolution lung images and transcriptomic, proteomic, and lipidomic human and mouse data and provides scientific information to stimulate interest in research careers for young audiences.

   abstract = {The vertebrate retina is comprised of seven major cell types that are generated in overlapping but well-defined intervals. To identify genes that might regulate retinal development, gene expression in the developing retina was profiled at multiple time points using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE). The expression patterns of 1,051 genes that showed developmentally dynamic expression by SAGE were investigated using in situ hybridization. A molecular atlas of gene expression in the developing and mature retina was thereby constructed, along with a taxonomic classification of developmental gene expression patterns. Genes were identified that label both temporal and spatial subsets of mitotic progenitor cells. For each developing and mature major retinal cell type, genes selectively expressed in that cell type were identified. The gene expression profiles of retinal Müller glia and mitotic progenitor cells were found to be highly similar, suggesting that Müller glia might serve to produce multiple retinal cell types under the right conditions. In addition, multiple transcripts that were evolutionarily conserved that did not appear to encode open reading frames of more than 100 amino acids in length ("noncoding RNAs") were found to be dynamically and specifically expressed in developing and mature retinal cell types. Finally, many photoreceptor-enriched genes that mapped to chromosomal intervals containing retinal disease genes were identified. These data serve as a starting point for functional investigations of the roles of these genes in retinal development and physiology.},

Understanding miRNA function requires a detailed determination of expression, yet this has not been reported in an amniote species. High-throughput whole mount in situ hybridization was performed on chicken embryos to map expression of 135 miRNA genes including five miRNAs that had not been previously reported in chicken. Eighty-four miRNAs were detected before day 5 of embryogenesis, and 75 miRNAs showed differential expression. Whereas few miRNAs were expressed during formation of the primary germ layers, the number of miRNAs detected increased rapidly during organogenesis. Patterns highlighted cell-type, organ or structure-specific expression, localization within germ layers and their derivatives, and expression in multiple cell and tissue types and within sub-regions of structures and tissues. A novel group of miRNAs was highly expressed in most tissues but much reduced in one or a few organs, including the heart. This study presents the first comprehensive overview of miRNA expression in an amniote organism and provides an important foundation for investigations of miRNA gene regulation and function. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

To define miRNA function in the eye, it is essential to determine a high-resolution profile of their spatial and temporal distribution.Results: In this report, we present the first comprehensive survey of miRNA expression in ocular tissues, using both microarray and RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) procedures. We initially determined the expression profiles of miRNAs in the retina, lens, cornea and retinal pigment epithelium of the adult mouse eye by microarray. Each tissue exhibited notably distinct miRNA enrichment patterns and cluster analysis identified groups of miRNAs that showed predominant expression in specific ocular tissues or combinations of them. Next, we performed RNA ISH for over 220 miRNAs, including those showing the highest expression levels by microarray, and generated a high-resolution expression atlas of miRNAs in the developing and adult wild-type mouse eye, which is accessible in the form of a publicly available web database. We found that 122 miRNAs displayed restricted expression domains in the eye at different developmental stages, with the majority of them expressed in one or more cell layers of the neural retina.Conclusions: This analysis revealed miRNAs with differential expression in ocular tissues and provided a detailed atlas of their tissue-specific distribution during development of the murine eye. The combination of the two approaches offers a valuable resource to decipher the contributions of specific miRNAs and miRNA clusters to the development of distinct ocular structures. © 2010 Karali et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-coding RNAs around 22 nucleotides long. They inhibit gene expression either by translational repression or by causing the degradation of the mRNAs they bind to. Many are highly conserved amongst diverse organisms and have restricted spatio-temporal expression patterns during embryonic development where they are thought to be involved in generating accuracy of developmental timing and in supporting cell fate decisions and tissue identity. We determined the expression patterns of 180 miRNAs in Xenopus laevis embryos using LNA oligonucleotides. In addition we carried out small RNA-seq on different stages of early Xenopus development, identified 44 miRNAs belonging to 29 new families and characterized the expression of 5 of these. Our analyses identified miRNA expression in many organs of the developing embryo. In particular a large number were expressed in neural tissue and in the somites. Surprisingly none of the miRNAs we have looked at show expression in the heart. Our results have been made freely available as a resource in both XenMARK and Xenbase.},

   abstract = {Ascertaining when and where genes are expressed is of crucial importance to understanding or predicting the physiological role of genes and proteins and how they interact to form the complex networks that underlie organ development and function. It is, therefore, crucial to determine on a genome-wide level, the spatio-temporal gene expression profiles at cellular resolution. This information is provided by colorimetric RNA in situ hybridization that can elucidate expression of genes in their native context and does so at cellular resolution. We generated what is to our knowledge the first genome-wide transcriptome atlas by RNA in situ hybridization of an entire mammalian organism, the developing mouse at embryonic day 14.5. This digital transcriptome atlas, the Eurexpress atlas (http://www.eurexpress.org), consists of a searchable database of annotated images that can be interactively viewed. We generated anatomy-based expression profiles for over 18,000 coding genes and over 400 microRNAs. We identified 1,002 tissue-specific genes that are a source of novel tissue-specific markers for 37 different anatomical structures. The quality and the resolution of the data revealed novel molecular domains for several developing structures, such as the telencephalon, a novel organization for the hypothalamus, and insight on the Wnt network involved in renal epithelial differentiation during kidney development. The digital transcriptome atlas is a powerful resource to determine co-expression of genes, to identify cell populations and lineages, and to identify functional associations between genes relevant to development and disease. © 2010 Diez-Roux et al.},

ZEBrA is a first of its kind gene expression brain atlas for a bird species and a first for any sauropsid. ZEBrA's >3,200 high-resolution digital images of in situ hybridized sections for ~650 genes (as of June 2019) are presented in alignment with an annotated histological atlas and can be browsed down to cellular resolution. An extensive relational database connects expression patterns to information about gene function, mouse expression patterns and phenotypes, and gene involvement in human diseases and communication disorders. By enabling brain-wide gene expression assessments in a bird, ZEBrA provides important substrates for comparative neuroanatomy and molecular brain evolution studies. ZEBrA also provides unique opportunities for linking genetic pathways to vocal learning and motor control circuits, as well as for novel insights into the molecular basis of sex steroids actions, brain dimorphisms, reproductive and social behaviors, sleep function, and adult neurogenesis, among many fundamental themes.},

   abstract = {We used enhancer trapping with the GAL4 transcriptional activator from yeast to obtain spatial control of transgene expression in all organs of the model monocotyledonous species rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare). Our T-DNA enhancer trapping cassette consisted of two principle components: (1) the minimal promoter-equipped gal4 gene placed adjacent to the right border, and (2) the green fluorescent protein gene (gfp) fused to the upstream activation sequence element (UAS) to which GAL4 binds and activates expression, so that gfp expression corresponds to gal4 expression. Agrobacterium-mediated integration of the cassette into the rice genome often brings the gal4 gene under transcriptional control of local genomic enhancers and promoters, resulting in gal4/gfp expression patterns ranging in specificity from single-cell types to constitutive expression. We produced more than 13 000 enhancer trap lines with this cassette and screened T0 adult plants (1982 lines), T 1 seed (2684 lines) and T1 seedlings (2667 lines) for gfp expression. Approximately 30% of the lines produced GFP, and we identified lines with gfp expression in specific cell types of all major organs of the rice plant. Subsequently, using the GUS reporter gene (uidA), we demonstrated that UAS:geneX constructs can be transactivated in specific cell types where gal4 and gfp are expressed, thus providing an excellent system for the manipulation of gene expression and physiological function in specific cell types of rice. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

In 80 lines, the reporter gene showed petal- and/or stamen-specific expression or lack of expression, or expression in distinct patterns within the petals and/or the stamens, including distinct suborgan domains of expression, such as tissue-specific lines marking epidermis and vasculature, as well as lines demarcating the proximodistal or abaxial/adaxial axes of the organs. Interestingly, reporter gene expression was typically restricted along the proximodistal axis of petals and stamens, indicating the importance of this developmental axis in patterning of gene expression domains in these organs. We identified novel domains of gene expression along the axis marking the midregion of the petals and apical and basal parts of the anthers. Most of the genes tagged in these 80 lines were identified, and their possible functions in petal and/or stamen differentiation are discussed. We also scored the floral phenotypes of the 1765 gene trap lines and recovered two mutants affecting previously uncharacterized genes. In addition to revealing common domains of gene expression, the gene trap lines reported here provide both useful markers and valuable starting points for reverse genetic analyses of the differentiation pathways in petal and stamen development. © 2005 American Society of Plant Biologists.},

Three strains of transformed flies were isolated and characterized by DNA blotting experiments and by in situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes. Strain Bg61 has a single insert of the hybrid gene at the tip of chromosome 3L, site 61A, and the insert consists of a structure that is consistent with P-element-mediated transposition. Strain Bg9,61 has inserts at both 61A and 9E, while Bg64 has a single insert at 64D. Heat shock induces the formation of a large chromosomal puff at all three sites. These puffs appear and regress with kinetics indistinguishable from the puffing of the heat shock locus, 87C, from which the hsp70 gene, used in these studies, was isolated. The β-galactosidase activity in the transformants is inducible by heat shock and shows a widespread distribution throughout the tissues of larvae and adults. © 1983.},

Direct analysis of the DNA of strains derived from such flies showed them to contain from one to five intact 3-kilobase P elements located at a wide variety of chromosomal sites. DNA sequences located outside the P element on the injected DNA were not transferred. Thus P elements can efficiently and selectively transpose from extrachromosomal DNA to the DNA of germ line chromosomes in Drosophila embryos.

Transposable elements of the Ac/Ds system carrying the GUS reporter gene have been designed to act as enhancer traps or gene traps. A novel selection scheme maximizes recovery of unlinked transposition events. In this study 491 plants carrying independent transposon insertions were generated and screened for expression patterns. One-half of the enhancer trap insertions and one- quarter of the gene trap insertions displayed GUS expression in seedlings or flowers, including expression patterns specific to organs, tissues, cell types, or developmental stages. The patterns identify genes that act during organogenesis, pattern formation, or cell differentiation. Transposon insertion lines with specific GUS expression patterns provide valuable markers for studies of Arabidopsis development and identify new cell types or subtypes in plants. The diversity of gene expression patterns generated suggests that the identification and cloning of Arabidopsis genes expressed in any developmental process is feasible using this system.},

These chromosomal domains can be detected using transgenes which integrate randomly throughout the genome, as their expression can be affected by chromosomal position1-3. Position effects are probably exerted most strongly on transgenes that do not contain strong promoters, enhancers or other modulating sequences. Here we have systematically explored position effects using a transgene with the weak herpes-simplex-virus thymidine-kinase promoter, linked to the readily visualized lacZ indicator gene (HSV-TK-lacZ). Each transgenic fetus with detectable expression displayed a unique lacZ staining pattern. Thus expression of this construct is apparently dictated entirely by its chromosomal position, without any construct specificity. Furthermore the transgene is faithfully transmitted to subsequent generations, allowing for systematic mapping of changes in expression during development and in adult life. These results demonstrate that transgenes can indeed be powerful tools to probe the genome for active chromosomal regions, with the potential for identifying endogenous genes involved in organogenesis and pattern formation. © 1988 Nature Publishing Group.},

Constructs lacking a promoter and including a β-galactosidase gene, or a reporter gene encoding a protein with both β-galactosidase and neomycin phosphotransferase activity, were designed so that activation of the reporter gene depends on its insertion within an active transcription unit. Such insertion events create a mutation in the tagged gene and allow its expression to be followed by β-galactosidase activity. Introduction of promoter trap constructs into embryonic stem (ES) cells by electroporation or retroviral infection has led to the derivation of transgenic lines that show a variety of β-galactosidase expression patterns. Intercrossing of heterozygotes from 24 strains that express β-galactosidase identified 9 strains in which homozygosity leads to an embryonic lethality. Because no overt phenotype was detected in the remaining strains, these results suggest that a substantial proportion of mammalian genes identified by this approach are not essential for development.},

The method incorporates an axonal marker, which helps to identify cellautonomous mechanisms in axon guidance, and has generated a resource of mouse lines with striking patterns of axonal labelling, which facilitates analysis of the normal wiring diagram of the brain. Studies of two of these mouse lines have identified an in vivo guidance function for a vertebrate transmembrane semaphorin, Sema6A, and have helped re-evaluate that of the Eph receptor EphA4.},

   abstract = {We have developed a large-scale, expression-based gene trap strategy to perform genome-wide functional analysis of the murine hematopoietic and vascular systems. Using two different gene trap vectors, we have isolated embryonic stem (ES) cell clones containing lacZreporter gene insertions in genes expressed in blood island and vascular cells, muscle, stromal cells, and unknown cell types. Of 79 clones demonstrating specific expression patterns, 49% and 16% were preferentially expressed in blood islands and/or the vasculature, respectively. The majority of ES clones that expressedlacZ in blood islands also expressed lacZ upon differentiation into hematopoietic cells on OP9 stromal layers. Importantly, the in vivo expression of the lacZ fusion products accurately recapitulated the observed in vitro expression patterns. Expression and sequence analysis of representative clones suggest that this approach will be useful for identifying and mutating novel genes expressed in the developing hematopoietic and vascular systems.},

The 'secretory trap' relies on capturing the N- terminal signal sequence of an endogenous gene to generate an active β- galactosidase fusion protein. Insertions were found in a cadherin gene, an unc6-related laminin (netrin) gene, the sek receptor tyrosine kinase gene, and genes encoding two receptor-linked protein-tyrosine phosphatases, LAR and PTP(κ). Analysis of homozygous mice carrying insertions in LAR and PTP(κ) showed that both genes were effectively disrupted, but neither was essential for normal embryonic development.},

   abstract = {We have developed a novel induction gene trap approach that preselects in vitro for integrations into genes that lie downstream of receptor/ligand- mediated signaling pathways. Using this approach, we have identified 20 gene trap integrations in embryonic stem cells, 9 of which were induced and 11 of which were repressed after exposure to exogenous retinoic acid (RA). All but one of these integrations showed unique spatially restricted or tissue- specific patterns of expression between 8.5 and 11.5 days of embryogenesis. Interestingly, expression was observed in tissues that are affected by alterations in RA levels during embryogenesis. Sequence analysis of fusion transcripts from six integrations revealed five novel gene sequences and the previously identified protooncogene c-fyn. To date, germ-line transmission and breeding has uncovered one homozygous embryonic lethal and three homozygous viable insertions. These studies demonstrate the potential of this induction gene trap approach for identifying and mutating genes downstream of signal transduction pathways.},

@article{Frohman1988,
   abstract = {We have devised a simple and efficient cDNA cloning strategy that overcomes many of the difficulties encountered in obtaining full-length cDNAs clones of low-abundance mRNAs. In essence, cDNAs are generated by using the DNA polymerase chain reaction technique to amplify copies of the region between a single point in the transcript and the 3' or 5' end. The minimum information required for this amplification is a single short stretch of sequence within the mRNA to be cloned. Since the cDNAs can be produced in one day, examined by Southern blotting the next, and readily cloned, large numbers of full-length cDNA clones of rare transcripts can be readily produced. Moreover, separation of amplified cDNAs by gel electrophoresis allows precise selection by size prior to cloning and thus facilitates the isolation of cDNAs representing variant mRNAs, such as those produced by alternative splicing or by the use of alternative promoters. The efficacy of this method was demonstrated by isolating cDNA clones of mRNA from int-2, a mouse gene that expresses four different transcripts at low abundance, the longest of which is ≃ 2.9 kilobases. After < 0.05% of the cDNAs produced had been screened, 29 independent int-2 clones were isolated. Sequence analysis demonstrated that the 3' and 5' ends of all four int-2 mRNAs were accurately represented by these clones.},

   abstract = {A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the whole-genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones made from the DNA of five individuals. Two assembly strategies - a whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome assembly - were used, each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort. The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and size of gaps in the final assembly over what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with independent mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90% of the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and 25% of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence and an additional ∼ 12,000 computationally derived genes with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence. Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost half the genes are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1% of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas 24% is in introns, with 75% of the genome being intergenic DNA. Duplications of segmental blocks, ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary history. Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate expansions of genes associated with neuronal function, with tissue-specific developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis and immune systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the consensus sequence and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1% of all SNPs resulted in variation in proteins, but the task of determining which SNPs have functional consequences remains an open challenge.},

Additionally, these systems are convenient for obtaining molecular markers specific for certain developmental processes. Elements for gene-trap and enhancer-trap systems were constructed using the uidA reporter gene with either a splice acceptor or a minimal promoter. Through a high rate of transformation conferred by a method utilizing homologous recombination, 235 gene-trap and 1073 enhancer-trap lines were obtained from 5637 and 3726 transgenic lines, respectively. The expression patterns of these trap lines in the moss gametophyte varied. The candidate gene trapped in a gene-trap tine YH209, which shows rhizoid-specific expression, was obtained by 5′ and 3′ RACE. This gene was named PpGLU, and forms a clade with plant acidic α-glucosidase genes. Thus, these gene-trap and enhancer-trap systems should prove useful to identify tissue- and cell-specific genes in Physcomitrella.},

   abstract = {Transgenic methods enable the selective manipulation of neurons for functional mapping of neuronal circuits. Using confocal microscopy, we have imaged the cellular-level expression of 109 transgenic lines in live 6 day post fertilization larvae, including 80 Gal4 enhancer trap lines, 9 Cre enhancer trap lines and 20 transgenic lines that express fluorescent proteins in defined gene-specific patterns. Image stacks were acquired at single micron resolution, together with a broadly expressed neural marker, which we used to align enhancer trap reporter patterns into a common 3-dimensional reference space. To facilitate use of this resource, we have written software that enables searching for transgenic lines that label cells within a selectable 3-dimensional region of interest (ROI) or neuroanatomical area. This software also enables the intersectional expression of transgenes to be predicted, a feature which we validated by detecting cells with co-expression of Cre and Gal4. Many of the imaged enhancer trap lines show intrinsic brain-specific expression. However, to increase the utility of lines that also drive expression in non-neuronal tissue we have designed a novel UAS reporter, that suppresses expression in heart, muscle, and skin through the incorporation of microRNA binding sites in a synthetic 3′ untranslated region. Finally, we mapped the site of transgene integration, thus providing molecular identification of the expression pattern for most lines. Cumulatively, this library of enhancer trap lines provides genetic access to 70% of the larval brain and is therefore a powerful and broadly accessible tool for the dissection of neural circuits in larval zebrafish.},

@article{Kawakami2010,
   abstract = {Background. We have developed genetic methods in zebrafish by using the Tol2 transposable element; namely, transgenesis, gene trapping, enhancer trapping and the Gal4FF-UAS system. Gene trap constructs contain a splice acceptor and the GFP or Gal4FF (a modified version of the yeast Gal4 transcription activator) gene, and enhancer trap constructs contain the zebrafish hsp70l promoter and the GFP or Gal4FF gene. By performing genetic screens using these constructs, we have generated transgenic zebrafish that express GFP and Gal4FF in specific cells, tissues and organs. Gal4FF expression is visualized by creating double transgenic fish carrying a Gal4FF transgene and the GFP reporter gene placed downstream of the Gal4-recognition sequence (UAS). Further, the Gal4FF-expressing cells can be manipulated by mating with UAS effector fish. For instance, when fish expressing Gal4FF in specific neurons are crossed with the UAS:TeTxLC fish carrying the tetanus neurotoxin gene downstream of UAS, the neuronal activities are inhibited in the double transgenic fish. Thus, these transgenic fish are useful to study developmental biology and neurobiology. Description. To increase the usefulness of the transgenic fish resource, we developed a web-based database named zTrap http://kawakami.lab.nig.ac.jp/ztrap/. The zTrap database contains images of GFP and Gal4FF expression patterns, and genomic DNA sequences surrounding the integration sites of the gene trap and enhancer trap constructs. The integration sites are mapped onto the Ensembl zebrafish genome by in-house Blat analysis and can be viewed on the zTrap and Ensembl genome browsers. Furthermore, zTrap is equipped with the functionality to search these data for expression patterns and genomic loci of interest. zTrap contains the information about transgenic fish including UAS reporter and effector fish. Conclusion. zTrap is a useful resource to find gene trap and enhancer trap fish lines that express GFP and Gal4FF in desired patterns, and to find insertions of the gene trap and enhancer trap constructs that are located within or near genes of interest. These transgenic fish can be utilized to observe specific cell types during embryogenesis, to manipulate their functions, and to discover novel genes and cis-regulatory elements. Therefore, zTrap should facilitate studies on genomics, developmental biology and neurobiology utilizing the transgenic zebrafish resource. © 2010 Kawakami et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {With the completion of genome sequencing projects, the next challenge is to close the gap between gene annotation and gene functional assignment. Genomic tools to identify gene functions are based on the analysis of phenotypic variations between a wild type and its mutant; hence, mutant collections are a valuable resource. In this sense, T-DNA collections allow for an easy and straightforward identification of the tagged gene, serving as the basis of both forward and reverse genetic strategies. This study reports on the phenotypic and molecular characterization of an enhancer trap T-DNA collection in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), which has been produced by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation using a binary vector bearing a minimal promoter fused to the uidA reporter gene. Two genes have been isolated from different T-DNA mutants, one of these genes codes for a UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase involved in programmed cell death and leaf development, which means a novel gene function reported in tomato. Together, our results support that enhancer trapping is a powerful tool to identify novel genes and regulatory elements in tomato and that this T-DNA mutant collection represents a highly valuable resource for functional analyses in this fleshy-fruited model species.},

We carried out a screen for cell type-specific green fluorescent protein expression in the retina using BAC transgenic mice from the GENSAT project. Among others, we identified mouse lines in which the inhibitory cell types of the night vision and directional selective circuit were selectively labeled. We quantified the stratification patterns to predict potential synaptic connectivity between marked cells of different lines and found that some of the lines enabled targeted recordings and imaging of cell types from developing or mature retinal circuits.

Expression in a variety of cell types and temporal patterns was observed with different construct pools. The most striking expression patterns were obtained when the /3-galactosidase activity was localized to subcellular structures by the C. elegans portion of the fusion protein.

   abstract = {Expression of the bacterial beta-galactosidase reporter gene (lacZ) in the vector used for the Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP) is driven by the endogenous promoter of the target gene. In tissues from KOMP mice, histochemical staining for LacZ enzyme activity can be used to determine gene expression patterns. With this technique, we have produced a comprehensive resource of gene expression using both whole mount (WM) and frozen section (FS) LacZ staining in 313 unique KOMP mutant mouse lines. Of these, ∼80% of mutants showed specific staining in one or more tissues, while ∼20% showed no specific staining, ∼13% had staining in only one tissue, and ∼25% had staining in >6 tissues. The highest frequency of specific staining occurred in the brain (∼50%), male gonads (42%), and kidney (39%). The WM method was useful for rapidly identifying whole organ and some substructure staining, while the FS method often revealed substructure and cellular staining specificity. Both staining methods had >90% repeatability in biological replicates. Nonspecific LacZ staining occurs in some tissues due to the presence of bacteria or endogenous enzyme activity. However, this can be effectively distinguished from reporter gene activity by the combination of the WM and FS methods. After careful annotation, LacZ staining patterns in a high percentage of mutants revealed a unique structure-function not previously reported for many of these genes. The validation of methods for LacZ staining, annotation, and expression analysis reported here provides unique insights into the function of genes for which little is currently known.},

High-throughput, largescale efforts are on-going internationally to characterise reportertagged knockout mouse lines. As part of that effort, we report an open access adult mouse expression resource, in which the expression profile of 424 genes has been assessed in up to 47 different organs, tissues and sub-structures using a lacZ reporter gene. Many specific and informative expression patterns were noted. Expression was most commonly observed in the testis and brain and was most restricted in white adipose tissue and mammary gland. Over half of the assessed genes presented with an absent or localised expression pattern (categorised as 0-10 positive structures). A link between complexity of expression profile and viability of homozygous null animals was observed; inactivation of genes expressed in ≥21 structures was more likely to result in reduced viability by postnatal day 14 compared with more restricted expression profiles. For validation purposes, this mouse expression resource was compared with Bgee, a federated composite of RNA-based expression data sets. Strong agreement was observed, indicating a high degree of specificity in our data. Furthermore, there were 1207 observations of expression of a particular gene in an anatomical structure where Bgee had no data, indicating a large amount of novelty in our data set. Examples of expression data corroborating and extending genotype-phenotype associations and supporting disease gene candidacy are presented to demonstrate the potential of this powerful resource.},

Though many of the genes required for its development have been identified, the distant-acting regulatory sequences orchestrating their in vivo expression are mostly unknown. Here, we describe a digital atlas of in vivo enhancers active in subregions of the developing telencephalon. We identified more than 4,600 candidate embryonic forebrain enhancers and studied the in vivo activity of 329 of these sequences in transgenic mouse embryos. We generated serial sets of histological brain sections for 145 reproducible forebrain enhancers, resulting in a publicly accessible web-based data collection comprising more than 32,000 sections. We also used epigenomic analysis of human and mouse cortex tissue to directly compare the genome-wide enhancer architecture in these species. These data provide a primary resource for investigating gene regulatory mechanisms of telencephalon development and enable studies of the role of distant-acting enhancers in neurodevelopmental disorders. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Transcriptional enhancers are crucial regulators of gene expression and animal development and the characterization of their genomic organization, spatiotemporal activities and sequence properties is a key goal in modern biology. Here we characterize the in vivo activity of 7,705 Drosophila melanogaster enhancer candidates covering 13.5% of the non-coding non-repetitive genome throughout embryogenesis. 3,557 (46%) candidates are active, suggesting a high density with 50,000 to 100,000 developmental enhancers genome-wide. The vast majority of enhancers display specific spatial patterns that are highly dynamic during development. Most appear to regulate their neighbouring genes, suggesting that the cis-regulatory genome is organized locally into domains, which are supported by chromosomal domains, insulator binding and genome evolution. However, 12 to 21 per cent of enhancers appear to skip non-expressed neighbours and regulate a more distal gene. Finally, we computationally identify cis-regulatory motifs that are predictive and required for enhancer activity, as we validate experimentally. This work provides global insights into the organization of an animal regulatory genome and the make-up of enhancer sequences and confirms and generalizes principles from previous studies. All enhancer patterns are annotated manually with a controlled vocabulary and all results are available through a web interface (http://enhancers.starklab.org), including the raw images of all microscopy slides for manual inspection at arbitrary zoom levels. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Using both manual and machine-assisted annotation, we describe the expression patterns in the most useful lines. We illustrate the utility of these data for identifying novel neuronal cell types, revealing brain asymmetry, and describing the nature and extent of neuronal shape stereotypy. The GAL4 lines allow expression of exogenous genes in distinct, small subsets of the adult nervous system.

   abstract = {In this article, we review an important cytogenetic technique - fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) - which is used for obtaining spatial genomic and transcriptomic information. FISH is widely utilized in genomic and cell biological research as well as for diagnostic applications in preventive and reproductive medicine, and oncology. It is the gold standard technique for the detection of chromosomal abnormalities. Despite the high specificity of FISH and the possibility of direct quantitative imaging, some of its key limitations prevent its regular use in diagnostics. To promote the extensive use of FISH for these applications, limitations in assay time and probe consumption will need to be addressed. Microfluidic technologies hold great promise in improving exactly these parameters. In the past two decades, microtechnology has matured and enabled a new line of analysis tools for biomedical and chemical sciences. Incidentally, the convergence of microtechnology with microfluidics is starting to have a decisive impact in the field of medical diagnostics. By miniaturizing implementations of diagnostic assays, the special characteristics of fluid flow in small volumes can be leveraged to modify reaction kinetics and thus reagent delivery time of assays. Here we highlight selected important historical views on FISH, review its current implementations, and provide a perspective on the future developments and the micro-scale implementations of FISH.},

   abstract = {A technique is described for forming molecular hybrids between RNA in solution and the DNA of intact cytological preparations. Cells in a conventional tissue squash are immobilized under a thin layer of agar. Next they are treated with alkali to denature the DNA and then incubated with tritium-labeled RNA. The hybrids are detected by autoradiography. The technique is illustrated by the hybridization of ribosomal RNA to the amplified ribosomal genes in oocytes of the toad Xenopus. A low level of gene amplification was also detected in premeiotic nuclei (oogonia). Several techniques are currently used for annealing RNA molecules to their complementary DNA sequences. For certain purposes both the RNA and DNA can be in solution,1' 2 but it is often more convenient to have the DNA immobilized in a solid or semisolid matrix,' 4 or attached to a nitrocellulose membrane filter.5 The hybrids are generally detected by scintillation counting of radioactive RNA after treatment with ribonuclease to remove unhybridized RNA. The hybridization of RNA to the DNA in a cytological preparation should exhibit a high degree of spatial localization, since each RNA species hybridizes only with sequences to which it is complementary. The general principles of a cytological hybridization technique are not difficult to lay down. The chromosomes or nucleus should be fixed in as lifelike a fashion as possible; basic proteins should be removed, since they are known to interfere with the hybridization procedure;5 the DNA should be denatured in such a way that cytological integrity is not lost; the hybridization should be carried out with radioactive RNA of very high specific activity, since the number of hybridized molecules at a given locus will be small; and detection should be by tritium autoradiography to permit maximal cytological resolution. This communication describes a cytological hybridization technique applicable to conventional squash preparations. It is illustrated by the hybridization of rRNA to the extrachromosomal rDNA in oocytes of the toad Xenopus. A preliminary report on the technique was presented in December 1968 at the International Symposium of Nuclear Physiology and Differentiation, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.'

   abstract = {The hippocampus consists of a series of cytoarchitecturally discrete subregions that can be distinguished from one another on the basis of morphology, connectivity, and electrophysiological properties. To understand the molecular underpinnings for these differences, DNA microarrays were used to find genes predicted to be enriched in subregions CA1, CA3, and the dentate gyrus, and >100 of these genes were subsequently analyzed using in situ hybridization to obtain cellular-level localization of their transcripts. The most striking commonality among the resulting patterns of gene expression is the extent to which cytoarchitectural boundaries within the hippocampus are respected, although the complexity of these patterns could not have been predicted on the basis of the microarray data alone. Among those genes with expression that can be characterized as "restricted" to neurons in one or more subregions of the hippocampus are a number of signal transduction molecules, transcription factors, calcium-binding proteins, and carbohydrate-modifying enzymes. These results suggest that important determinants of the unique identities of adult hippocampal neurons are differential signal transduction, regulation of gene expression, calcium homeostasis, and the maintenance of a unique extracellular milieu. Furthermore, the extremely high correlation between microarray data and in situ expression demonstrates the great utility of using DNA microarrays to genetically profile discrete brain regions.},

This procedure utilizes a biotin-labeled analog of TTP that can be incorporated enzymatically into DNA probes by nick-translation. After hybridization in situ, the biotin molecules in the probe serve as antigens which bind affinity-purified rabbit antibiotin antibodies. The site of hybridization is then detected either fluorimetrically, by using fluorescein-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG, or cytochemically, by using an anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. When combined with Giemsa staining, the immunoperoxidase detection method provides a permanent record that is suitable for detailed cytogenetic analysis. This immunological approach offers four advantages over conventional autoradiographic procedures for detecting in situ hybrids: the time required to determine the site of hybridization is decreased markedly; biotin-labeled probes are chemically stable and give reproducible results for many months; biotin-labeled probes appear to produce less background noise than do radiolabeled probes; and the resolving power is equal to and often greater than that achieved autoradiographically.},

We detected three classes of maternal RNAs: RNAs that are maintained in all cells, RNAs that are maintained in germline cells but are lost from somatic cells, and a population of RNAs that are associated with the germline-specific P granules. We observed embryonically transcribed RNAs in somatic cells as early as the 4-cell stage. These transcripts were not detected in germline cells. These observations suggest that mechanisms which distinguish between soma and germline cause asymmetries in mRNA stability and transcription within the first few cleavages of C. elegans embryogenesis.},

Our approach utilizes a new method for screening large numbers of cDNAs by whole-embryo in situ hybridization. The cDNA library for the screen was prepared from rough endoplasmic reticulum-bound mRNA and is therefore enriched in clones encoding membrane and secreted proteins. To increase the prevalence of rare cDNAs in the library, the library was normalized using a method based on cDNA hybridization to genomic DNA-coated beads. In total, 2,518 individual cDNAs from the normalized library were screened by in situ hybridization, and 917 of these cDNAs represent genes differentially expressed during embryonic development. Sequence analysis of 1,001 cDNAs indicated that 811 represent genes not previously described in Drosophila. Expression pattern photographs and partial DNA sequences have been assembled in a database publicly available at the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project website (http://fruitfly.berkeley.edu).

   abstract = {Collections of full-length nonredundant cDNA clones are critical reagents for functional genomics. The first step toward these resources is the generation and single-pass sequencing of cDNA libraries that contain a high proportion of full-length clones. The first release of the Drosophila Gene Collection Release 1 (DGCr1) was produced from six libraries representing various tissues, developmental stages, and the cultured S2 cell line. Nearly 80,000 random 5′ expressed sequence tags (5′ expressed sequence tags [ESTs]from these libraries were collapsed into a nonredundant set of 5849 cDNAs, corresponding to ∼40% of the 13,474 predicted genes in Drosophila. To obtain cDNA clones representing the remaining genes, we have generated an additional 157,835 5′ ESTs from two previously existing and three new libraries. One new library is derived from adult testis, a tissue we previously did not exploit for gene discovery; two new cap-trapped normalized libraries are derived from 0-22-h embryos and adult heads. Taking advantage of the annotated D. melanogaster genome sequence, we clustered the ESTs by aligning them to the genome. Clusters that overlap genes not already represented by cDNA clones in the DGCr1 were analyzed further, and putative full-length clones were selected for inclusion in the new DGC. This second release of the DGC (DGCr2) contains 5061 additional clones, extending the collection to 10,910 cDNAs representing >70% of the predicted genes in Drosophila. ©2002 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

To overcome these problems, we have developed a microarray platform containing in situ-synthesized 60-mer oligonucleotide probes representing approximately 22,000 unique mouse transcripts, assembled primarily from sequences of stem cell and embryo cDNA libraries. We have optimized RNA labeling protocols and experimental designs to use as little as 2 ng total RNA reliably and reproducibly.

However, large-scale studies are made difficult by the size of the embryos (∼60 μm diameter) and their fragility. We have developed a chamber system that allows parallel processing of embryos without the aid of a microscope. We first selected 91 candidate genes that were transcription factors highly expressed in blastocysts, and more highly expressed in embryonic (ES) than in trophoblast (TS) stem cells. We then used the WISH to identify 48 genes expressed predominantly in the inner cell mass (ICM) and to follow several of these genes in all seven preimplantation stages. The ICM-predominant expressions of these genes suggest their involvement in the pluripotency of embryonic cells. This system provides a useful tool to a systematic genome-scale analysis of preimplantation embryos.},

By modifying DNA oligonucleotides with LNAs using a design, in which every third nucleotide position was substituted by LNA, we could use the probes in northern blot analysis employing standard end-labelling techniques and hybridization conditions. The sensitivity in detecting mature microRNAs by northern blots was increased by at least 10-fold compared to DNA probes, while simultaneously being highly specific, as demonstrated by the use of different single and double mismatched LNA probes. Besides being highly efficient as northern probes, the same LNA-modified oligonucleotide probes would also be useful for miRNA in situ hybridization and miRNA expression profiling by LNA oligonucleotide microarrays.},

Although computational methods have identified many potential targets of miRNAs, elucidating the spatial expression patterns of miRNAs is necessary to identify the sites of miRNA action. Here, we report the spatial patterns of miRNA transcription during Drosophila embryonic development, as revealed by in situ hybridization to nascent miRNA transcripts. We detect expression of 15 "stand-alone" miRNA loci and 9 intronic miRNA loci, which collectively represent 38 miRNA genes. We observe great variety in the spatial patterns of miRNA transcription, including preblastoderm stripes, in aspects of the central and peripheral nervous systems, and in cellular subsets of the mesoderm and endoderm. We also describe an intronic miRNA (miR-7) whose expression pattern is distinct from that of its host mRNA (bancal), which demonstrates that intronic miRNAs can be subject to independent cis-regulatory control. Intriguingly, the expression patterns of several fly miRNAs are analogous to those of their vertebrate counterparts, suggesting that these miRNAs may have ancient roles in animal patterning. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

   abstract = {Background: In eukaryotic cells, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) contribute to gene expression by regulating the form, abundance, and stability of both coding and non-coding RNA. In the vertebrate brain, RBPs account for many distinctive features of RNA processing such as activity-dependent transcript localization and localized protein synthesis. Several RBPs with activities that are important for the proper function of adult brain have been identified, but how many RBPs exist and where these genes are expressed in the developing brain is uncharacterized. Results: Here we describe a comprehensive catalogue of the unique RBPs encoded in the mouse genome and provide an online database of RBP expression in developing brain. We identified 380 putative RBPs in the mouse genome. Using in situ hybridization, we visualized the expression of 323 of these RBP genes in the brains of developing mice at embryonic day 13.5, when critical fate choice decisions are made and at P0, when major structural components of the adult brain are apparent. We demonstrate i) that 16 of the 323 RBPs examined show neural-specific expression at the stages we examined, and ii) that a far larger subset (221) shows regionally restricted expression in the brain. Of the regionally restricted RBPs, we describe one group that is preferentially expressed in the E13.5 ventricular areas and a second group that shows spatially restricted expression in postmitotic regions of the embryonic brain. Additionally, we find a subset of RBPs that share the same complex pattern of expression, in proliferating regions of the embryonic and postnatal NS and peripheral tissues. Conclusion: Our data show that, in contrast to their proposed ubiquitous involvement in gene regulation, most RBPs are not uniformly expressed. Here we demonstrate the region-specific expression of RBPs in proliferating vs. post-mitotic brain regions as well as cell-type-specific RBP expression. We identify uncharacterized RBPs that exhibit neural-specific expression as well as novel RBPs that show expression in non-neural tissues. The data presented here and in an online database provide a visual filter for the functional analysis of individual RBPs. © 2005 McKee et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {Background: In situ hybridization (ISH) is a powerful method for visualizing gene expression patterns at the organismal level with cellular resolution. When automated, it is capable of determining the expression of a large number of genes. Results: The expression patterns of 662 genes that encode enzymes were determined by ISH in the mid-gestation mouse embryo, a stage that models the complexity of the adult organism. Forty-five percent of transcripts encoding metabolic enzymes (n = 297) showed a regional expression pattern. A similar percentage was found for the 190 kinases that were also analyzed. Many mRNAs encoding glycolytic and TCA cycle enzymes exhibited a characteristic expression pattern. The annotated expression patterns were deposited on the Genepaint database and are retrievable by user-defined queries including gene name and sites of expression. Conclusion: The 662 expression patterns discussed here comprised gene products with activities associated with catalysis. Preliminary analysis of these data revealed that a significant number of genes encoding housekeeping functions such as biosynthesis and catabolism were expressed regionally, so they could be used as tissue-specific gene markers. We found no difference in tissue specificity between mRNAs encoding housekeeping functions and those encoding components of signal transduction pathways, as exemplified by the kinases. © 2007 Cankaya et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

This approach implicated 43 genes in regulation of embryonic myogenesis, including a transcriptional repressor, the zinc-finger protein RP58 (also known as Zfp238). Knockout and knockdown approaches confirmed an essential role for RP58 in skeletal myogenesis. Cell-based high-throughput transfection screening revealed that RP58 is a direct MyoD target. Microarray analysis identified two inhibitors of skeletal myogenesis, Id2 and Id3, as targets for RP58-mediated repression. Consistently, MyoD-dependent activation of the myogenic program is impaired in RP58 null fibroblasts and downregulation of Id2 and Id3 rescues MyoD's ability to promote myogenesis in these cells.

To perform such multifaceted tasks depends on stringent regulation of expression of cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes (CBEs). We established for a whole organism, for the fi rst time, the 3D expression pattern of all genes required for cholesterol biosynthesis (CBS), starting from acetyl-CoA and ending with cholesterol. This data was produced by high-throughput in situ hybridization on serial sections through the mouse fetus. The textually annotated image data were seamlessly integrated into the METscout and GenePaint public databases. This novel information helps in the understanding of why CBEs are expressed at particular locations within the fetus. For example, strong CBE expression is detected at sites of cell proliferation and also where cell growth increases membrane surface, such as in neurons sprouting axons and forming synapses. The CBE data also sheds light on the spatial relationship of cells and tissue that express sonic Hh (Shh) and produce cholesterol, respectively. We discovered that not all cells expressing Shh are capable of CBS. This fi nding suggests novel ways by which cholesterylation of Shh is regulated.},

Although malformations of these structures have been implicated in many human eye diseases, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that control their development. To identify genes involved in anterior segment formation, we developed a large-scale in situ hybridization screen and examined the spatial and temporal expression of over 1000 genes during eye development. This screen identified 62 genes with distinct expression patterns in specific eye structures, including several expressed in novel patterns in the anterior segment. Using these genes as developmental markers, we tested for the presence of inductive signals that control the differentiation of anterior segment tissues. Organ culture recombination experiments showed that a chick lens is capable of inducing the expression of markers of the presumptive iris and ciliary body in the developing mouse neural retina. The inducing activity from the lens acts only over short ranges and is present at multiple stages of eye development. These studies provide molecular evidence that an evolutionarily conserved signal from the lens controls tissue specification in the developing optic cup. © 2001 Academic Press.},

Enormous amounts of such data are available in literature, where each paper reports on a limited number of genes and developmental stages. The best way to make these data accessible is via spatio-temporal gene expression atlases. Eleven atlases, describing developing vertebrates and covering at least 100 genes, were reviewed. This review focuses on: (i) the used anatomical framework, (ii) the handling of input data and (iii) the retrieval of information. Our aim is to provide insights into both the possibilities of the atlases, as well as to describe what more than a decade of developmental gene expression atlases can teach us about the requirements of the design of the 'ideal atlas'. This review shows that most ingredients needed to develop the ideal atlas are already applied to some extent in at least one of the discussed atlases. A review of these atlases shows that the ideal atlas should be based on a spatial framework, i.e. a series of 3D reference models, which is anatomically annotated using an ontology with sufficient resolution, both for relations as well as for anatomical terms. © The Author(s) 2009.

It is closely linked with the MGI/GXD database at the Jackson Laboratory and holds links to almost all available image-based gene-expression data for the mouse embryo. In this resource article we describe the novel web-based tools we have developed for 3D visualisation of embryo anatomy and gene expression. We show how mapping of gene expression data onto spatial models delivers a framework for capturing gene expression that enhances our understanding of development, and we review the exploratory tools utilised by the EMAGE gene expression database as a means of defining co-expression of in situ hybridisation, immunohistochemistry, and lacZ-omic expression patterns. We report on recent developments of the eHistology atlas and our use of web-services to support embedding of the online ‘The Atlas of Mouse Development’ in the context of other resources such as the DMDD mouse phenotype database. In addition, we discuss new developments including a cellular-resolution placental atlas, third-party atlas models, clonal analysis data and a new interactive eLearning resource for developmental processes.},

This release gives access to annotated genomes, gene expression patterns, and anatomical descriptions for nine ascidian species. It provides increased integration with external molecular and taxonomy databases, better support for epigenomics datasets, in particular RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and SELEX-seq, and features novel interactive interfaces for existing and novel datatypes. In particular, the cross-species navigation and comparison is enhanced through a novel taxonomy section describing each represented species and through the implementation of interactive phylogenetic gene trees for 60% of tunicate genes. The gene expression section displays the results of RNA-seq experiments for the three major model species of solitary ascidians. Gene expression is controlled by the binding of transcription factors to cis-regulatory sequences. A high-resolution description of the DNA-binding specificity for 131 Ciona robusta (formerly C. intestinalis type A) transcription factors by SELEX-seq is provided and used to map candidate binding sites across the Ciona robusta and Phallusia mammillata genomes. Finally, use of a WashU Epigenome browser enhances genome navigation, while a Genomicus server was set up to explore microsynteny relationships within tunicates and with vertebrates, Amphioxus, echinoderms and hemichordates.},

Drosophila melanogaster is ideal for such investigations as multiple individual and high-throughput efforts have captured the spatiotemporal patterns of thousands of embryonic expressed genes in the form of in situ images. FlyExpress (www.flyexpress.net), a knowledgebase based on a massive and unique digital library of standardized images and a simple search engine to find coexpressed genes, was created to facilitate the analytical and visual mining of these patterns. Here, we introduce the next generation of FlyExpress resources to facilitate the integrative analysis of sequence data and spatiotemporal patterns of expression from images. FlyExpress 7 now includes over 100,000 standardized in situ images and implements a more efficient, user-defined search algorithm to identify coexpressed genes via Genomewide Expression Maps (GEMs). Shared motifs found in the upstream 59 regions of any pair of coexpressed genes can be visualized in an interactive dotplot. Additional webtools and link-outs to assist in the downstream validation of candidate motifs are also provided. Together, FlyExpress 7 represents our largest effort yet to accelerate discovery via the development and dispersal of new webtools that allow researchers to perform data-driven analyses of coexpression (image) and genomic (sequence) data.},

   abstract = {Background: A large number of online atlases and databases have been developed to mange the rapidly growing amount of data describing embryogenesis. As these community resources continue to evolve, it is important to understand how representations of anatomy can facilitate the sharing and integration of data. In addition, attention to the design of the interfaces is critical to make online resources useful and usable. Results: I first present a survey of online atlases and gene expression resources for model organisms, with a focus on methods of semantic and spatial representation of anatomy. A total of 14 anatomical atlases and 21 gene expression resources are included. This survey demonstrates how choices in semantic representation, in the form of ontologies, can enhance interface search functions and provide links between relevant information. This survey also reviews methods for spatially representing anatomy in online resources. I then provide a collection of patterns for interface design based on the atlases and databases surveyed. These patterns include methods for displaying graphics, integrating semantic and spatial representations, organizing information, and querying databases to find genes expressed in anatomical structures. Conclusions: This collection of patterns for interface design will assist biologists and software developers in planning the interfaces of new atlases and databases or enhancing existing ones. They also show the benefits of standardizing semantic and spatial representations of anatomy by demonstrating how interfaces can use standardization to provide enhanced functionality.},

Thanks to recent progress in genomics and imaging technologies, systemic approaches are now used in parallel with small-scale studies to establish links between genomic information and phenotypes, often described at the subcellular level. Current model organism databases, however, do not integrate heterogeneous data sets at different scales into a global view of the developmental program. Here, we present a novel, generic digital system, NISEED, and its implementation, ANISEED, to ascidians, which are invertebrate chordates suitable for developmental systems biology approaches. ANISEED hosts an unprecedented combination of anatomical and molecular data on ascidian development. This includes the first detailed anatomical ontologies for these embryos, and quantitative geometrical descriptions of developing cells obtained from reconstructed three-dimensional (3D) embryos up to the gastrula stages. Fully annotated gene model sets are linked to 30,000 high-resolution spatial gene expression patterns in wild-type and experimentally manipulated conditions and to 528 experimentally validated cis-regulatory regions imported from specialized databases or extracted from 160 literature articles. This highly structured data set can be explored via a Developmental Browser, a Genome Browser, and a 3D Virtual Embryo module. We show how integration of heterogeneous data in ANISEED can provide a system-level understanding of the developmental program through the automatic inference of gene regulatory interactions, the identification of inducing signals, and the discovery and explanation of novel asymmetric divisions. © 2010 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

For this purpose, the image is first subjected to a registration process that involves edge fitting and size-standardization. It is followed by segmentation in order to delineate the expression pattern from the cellular background. The moment invariants for the segmented pattern are computed. Image dissimilarity between images is computed based on these moment invariants for each image pair. Area and Centroids of the segmented expression shapes are used to neutralize the invariant behavior of moment invariants during image retrieval.

   abstract = {The precise anatomical location of gene expression is an essential component of the study of gene function. For most model organisms this task is usually undertaken via visual inspection of gene expression images by interested researchers. Computational analysis of gene expression has been developed in several model organisms, notably in Drosophila which exhibits a uniform shape and outline in the early stages of development. Here we address the challenge of computational analysis of gene expression in Xenopus, where the range of developmental stages of interest encompasses a wide range of embryo size and shape. Embryos may have different orientation across images, and, in addition, embryos have a pigmented epidermis that can mask or confuse underlying gene expression. Here we report the development of a set of computational tools capable of processing large image sets with variable characteristics. These tools efficiently separate the Xenopus embryo from the background, separately identify both histochemically stained and naturally pigmented regions within the embryo, and can sort images from the same gene and developmental stage according to similarity of gene expression patterns without information about relative orientation. We tested these methods on a large, but highly redundant, collection of 33,289 in situ hybridization images, allowing us to select representative images of expression patterns at different embryo orientations. This has allowed us to put a much smaller subset of these images into the public domain in an effective manner. The ‘isimage’ module and the scripts developed are implemented in Python and freely available on https://pypi.python.org/pypi/isimage/.},

   abstract = {Background: Modern developmental biology relies heavily on the analysis of embryonic gene expression patterns. Investigators manually inspect hundreds or thousands of expression patterns to identify those that are spatially similar and to ultimately infer potential gene interactions. However, the rapid accumulation of gene expression pattern data over the last two decades, facilitated by high-throughput techniques, has produced a need for the development of efficient approaches for direct comparison of images, rather than their textual descriptions, to identify spatially similar expression patterns. Results: The effectiveness of the Binary Feature Vector (BFV) and Invariant Moment Vector (IMV) based digital representations of the gene expression patterns in finding biologically meaningful patterns was compared for a small (226 images) and a large (1819 images) dataset. For each dataset, an ordered list of images, with respect to a query image, was generated to identify overlapping and similar gene expression patterns, in a manner comparable to what a developmental biologist might do. The results showed that the BFV representation consistently outperforms the IMV representation in finding biologically meaningful matches when spatial overlap of the gene expression pattern and the genes involved are considered. Furthermore, we explored the value of conducting image-content based searches in a dataset where individual expression components (or domains) of multi-domain expression patterns were also included separately. We found that this technique improves performance of both IMV and BFV based searches. Conclusions: We conclude that the BFV representation consistently produces a more extensive and better list of biologically useful patterns than the IMV representation. The high quality of results obtained scales well as the search database becomes larger, which encourages efforts to build automated image query and retrieval systems for spatial gene expression patterns. © 2004 Gurunathan et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {Background: The Allen Brain Atlas (ABA) project systematically profiles three-dimensional high-resolution gene expression in postnatal mouse brains for thousands of genes. By unveiling gene behaviors at both the cellular and molecular levels, ABA is becoming a unique and comprehensive neuroscience data source for decoding enigmatic biological processes in the brain. Given the unprecedented volume and complexity of the in situ hybridization image data, data mining in this area is extremely challenging. Currently, the ABA database mainly serves as an online reference for visual inspection of individual genes; the underlying rich information of this large data set is yet to be explored by novel computational tools. In this proof-of-concept study, we studied the hypothesis that genes sharing similar three-dimensional expression profiles in the mouse brain are likely to share similar biological functions. Results: In order to address the pattern comparison challenge when analyzing the ABA database, we developed a robust image filtering method, dubbed histogram-row-column (HRC) algorithm. We demonstrated how the HRC algorithm offers the sensitivity of identifying a manageable number of gene pairs based on automatic pattern searching from an original large brain image collection. This tool enables us to quickly identify genes of similar in situ hybridization patterns in a semi-automatic fashion and consequently allows us to discover several gene expression patterns with expression neighborhoods containing genes of similar functional categories. Conclusion: Given a query brain image, HRC is a fully automated algorithm that is able to quickly mine vast number of brain images and identify a manageable subset of genes that potentially shares similar spatial co-distribution patterns for further visual inspection. A three-dimensional in situ hybridization pattern, if statistically significant, could serve as a fingerprint of certain gene function. Databases such as ABA provide valuable data source for characterizing brain-related gene functions when armed with powerful image querying tools like HRC. © 2007 Liu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Most analyses to date rely on biologists' visual inspection of microscope images, which for large-scale datasets becomes impractical and subjective. In this paper, we introduce a new method for clustering 2D images of gene expression patterns in Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) embryos. These patterns, typically generated from in situ hybridization of mRNA probes, reveal when, where and how abundantly a target gene is expressed. Our method involves two steps. First, we use an eigen-embryo model to reduce noise and generate feature vectors that form a better basis for capturing the salient aspects of quantized embryo images. Second, we cluster these feature vectors by an efficient minimum-spanning-tree partition algorithm. We investigate this approach on fly embryo datasets that span the entire course of embryogenesis. The experimental results show that our clustering algorithm produces superior pattern clusters. We also find previously unobserved clusters of genes that share biologically interesting patterns of gene-expression. © 2006 IEEE.},

The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

Results: We develop a system to automatically annotate a fruitfly's embryonic tissue in which a gene has expression. We formulate the task as an image pattern recognition problem. For a new fly embryo image, our system answers two questions: (1) Which stage range does an image belong to? (2) Which annotations should be assigned to an image? We propose to identify the wavelet embryo features by multi-resolution 2D wavelet discrete transform, followed by min-redundancy max-relevance feature selection, which yields optimal distinguishing features for an annotation. We then construct a series of parallel bi-class predictors to solve the multi-objective annotation problem since each image may correspond to multiple annotations. © 2007 Oxford University Press.},

   abstract = {Motivation: Regulation of gene expression in space and time directs its localization to a specific subset of cells during development. Systematic determination of the spatiotemporal dynamics of gene expression plays an important role in understanding the regulatory networks driving development. An atlas for the gene expression patterns of fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has been created by whole-mount in situ hybridization, and it documents the dynamic changes of gene expression pattern during Drosophila embryogenesis. The spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression are integrated by anatomical terms from a controlled vocabulary linking together intermediate tissues developed from one another. Currently, the terms are assigned to patterns manually. However, the number of patterns generated by high-throughput in situ hybridization is rapidly increasing. It is, therefore, tempting to approach this problem by employing computational methods. Results: In this article, we present a novel computational framework for annotating gene expression patterns using a controlled vocabulary. In the currently available high-throughput data, annotation terms are assigned to groups of patterns rather than to individual images. We propose to extract invariant features from images, and construct pyramid match kernels to measure the similarity between sets of patterns. To exploit the complementary information conveyed by different features and incorporate the correlation among patterns sharing common structures, we propose efficient convex formulations to integrate the kernels derived from various features. The proposed framework is evaluated by comparing its annotation with that of human curators, and promising performance in terms of F1 score has been reported. © The Author 2008.

The spatio-temporal gene expression patterns of Drosophila melanogaster can be visualized by in situ hybridization and documented as digital images. Automated and efficient tools for analyzing these expression images will provide biological insights into the gene functions, interactions, and networks. To facilitate pattern recognition and comparison, many web-based resources have been created to conduct comparative analysis based on the body part keywords and the associated images. With the fast accumulation of images from high-throughput techniques, manual inspection of images will impose a serious impediment on the pace of biological discovery. It is thus imperative to design an automated system for efficient image annotation and comparison.Results: We present a computational framework to perform anatomical keywords annotation for Drosophila gene expression images. The spatial sparse coding approach is used to represent local patches of images in comparison with the well-known bag-of-words (BoW) method. Three pooling functions including max pooling, average pooling and Sqrt (square root of mean squared statistics) pooling are employed to transform the sparse codes to image features. Based on the constructed features, we develop both an image-level scheme and a group-level scheme to tackle the key challenges in annotating Drosophila gene expression pattern images automatically. To deal with the imbalanced data distribution inherent in image annotation tasks, the undersampling method is applied together with majority vote. Results on Drosophila embryonic expression pattern images verify the efficacy of our approach.Conclusion: In our experiment, the three pooling functions perform comparably well in feature dimension reduction. The undersampling with majority vote is shown to be effective in tackling the problem of imbalanced data.

We present a systematic approach for automating this task, because the number of images needing text descriptions is now rapidly increasing. We consider both improved feature representation and novel learning formulation to boost the annotation performance. For feature representation, we adapt the bag-of-words scheme commonly used in visual recognition problems so that the image group information in the BDGP study is retained. Moreover, images from multiple views can be integrated naturally in this representation. To reduce the quantization error caused by the bag-of-words representation, we propose an improved feature representation scheme based on the sparse learning technique. In the design of learning formulation, we propose a local regularization framework that can incorporate the correlations among terms explicitly. We further show that the resulting optimization problem admits an analytical solution. Experimental results show that the representation based on sparse learning outperforms the bag-of-words representation significantly. Results also show that incorporation of the term-term correlations improves the annotation performance consistently. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

Images now reveal highly complex patterns of gene expression varying on multiple scales. The challenge in analyzing these images is both in extracting the patterns that are most relevant functionally and in providing a meaningful representation that allows neuroscientists to interpret the extracted patterns.Results: Here, we present FuncISH - A method to learn functional representations of neural in situ hybridization (ISH) images. We represent images using a histogram of local descriptors in several scales, and we use this representation to learn detectors of functional (GO) categories for every image. As a result, each image is represented as a point in a low-dimensional space whose axes correspond to meaningful functional annotations. The resulting representations define similarities between ISH images that can be easily explained by functional categories. We applied our method to the genomic set of mouse neural ISH images available at the Allen Brain Atlas, finding that most neural biological processes can be inferred from spatial expression patterns with high accuracy. Using functional representations, we predict several gene interaction properties, such as protein-protein interactions and cell-type specificity, more accurately than competing methods based on global correlations. We used FuncISH to identify similar expression patterns of GABAergic neuronal markers that were not previously identified and to infer new gene function based on image-image similarities. © The Author 2013.},

   abstract = {Background: Multicellular organisms consist of cells of many different types that are established during development. Each type of cell is characterized by the unique combination of expressed gene products as a result of spatiotemporal gene regulation. Currently, a fundamental challenge in regulatory biology is to elucidate the gene expression controls that generate the complex body plans during development. Recent advances in high-throughput biotechnologies have generated spatiotemporal expression patterns for thousands of genes in the model organism fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Existing qualitative methods enhanced by a quantitative analysis based on computational tools we present in this paper would provide promising ways for addressing key scientific questions.Results: We develop a set of computational methods and open source tools for identifying co-expressed embryonic domains and the associated genes simultaneously. To map the expression patterns of many genes into the same coordinate space and account for the embryonic shape variations, we develop a mesh generation method to deform a meshed generic ellipse to each individual embryo. We then develop a co-clustering formulation to cluster the genes and the mesh elements, thereby identifying co-expressed embryonic domains and the associated genes simultaneously. Experimental results indicate that the gene and mesh co-clusters can be correlated to key developmental events during the stages of embryogenesis we study. The open source software tool has been made available at http://compbio.cs.odu.edu/fly/.Conclusions: Our mesh generation and machine learning methods and tools improve upon the flexibility, ease-of-use and accuracy of existing methods. © 2013 Zhang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {Background: Many important high throughput projects use in situ hybridization and may require the analysis of images of spatial cross sections of organisms taken with cellular level resolution. Projects creating gene expression atlases at unprecedented scales for the embryonic fruit fly as well as the embryonic and adult mouse already involve the analysis of hundreds of thousands of high resolution experimental images mapping mRNA expression patterns. Challenges include accurate registration of highly deformed tissues, associating cells with known anatomical regions, and identifying groups of genes whose expression is coordinately regulated with respect to both concentration and spatial location. Solutions to these and other challenges will lead to a richer understanding of the complex system aspects of gene regulation in heterogeneous tissue. Results: We present an end-to-end approach for processing raw in situ expression imagery and performing subsequent analysis. We use a non-linear, information theoretic based image registration technique specifically adapted for mapping expression images to anatomical annotations and a method for extracting expression information within an anatomical region. Our method consists of coarse registration, fine registration, and expression feature extraction steps. From this we obtain a matrix for expression characteristics with rows corresponding to genes and columns corresponding to anatomical sub-structures. We perform matrix block cluster analysis using a novel row-column mixture model and we relate clustered patterns to Gene Ontology (GO) annotations. Conclusion: Resulting registrations suggest that our method is robust over intensity levels and shape variations in ISH imagery. Functional enrichment studies from both simple analysis and block clustering indicate that gene relationships consistent with biological knowledge of neuronal gene functions can be extracted from large ISH image databases such as the Allen Brain Atlas 1 and the Max-Planck Institute 2 using our method. While we focus here on imagery and experiments of the mouse brain our approach should be applicable to a variety of in situ experiments. © 2007 Jagalur et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Characterization of these patterns in an unbiased, integrated, and anatomically comprehensive manner will illuminate the higher-order transcriptome organization and offer genetic foundations of functional circuitry. Here using dictionary learning and sparse coding, we derived coexpression networks from the space-resolved anatomical comprehensive in situ hybridization data from Allen Mouse Brain Atlas dataset. The key idea is that if two genes use the same dictionary to represent their original signals, then their gene expressions must share similar patterns, thereby considering them as “coexpressed.” For each network, we have simultaneous knowledge of spatial distributions, the genes in the network and the extent a particular gene conforms to the coexpression pattern. Gene ontologies and the comparisons with published gene lists reveal biologically identified coexpression networks, some of which correspond to major cell types, biological pathways, and/or anatomical regions.},

   abstract = {Background: Profiling gene expression in brain structures at various spatial and temporal scales is essential to understanding how genes regulate the development of brain structures. The Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas provides high-resolution 3-D in situ hybridization (ISH) gene expression patterns in multiple developing stages of the mouse brain. Currently, the ISH images are annotated with anatomical terms manually. In this paper, we propose a computational approach to annotate gene expression pattern images in the mouse brain at various structural levels over the course of development. Results: We applied deep convolutional neural network that was trained on a large set of natural images to extract features from the ISH images of developing mouse brain. As a baseline representation, we applied invariant image feature descriptors to capture local statistics from ISH images and used the bag-of-words approach to build image-level representations. Both types of features from multiple ISH image sections of the entire brain were then combined to build 3-D, brain-wide gene expression representations. We employed regularized learning methods for discriminating gene expression patterns in different brain structures. Results show that our approach of using convolutional model as feature extractors achieved superior performance in annotating gene expression patterns at multiple levels of brain structures throughout four developing ages. Overall, we achieved average AUC of 0.894 ± 0.014, as compared with 0.820 ± 0.046 yielded by the bag-of-words approach. Conclusions: Deep convolutional neural network model trained on natural image sets and applied to gene expression pattern annotation tasks yielded superior performance, demonstrating its transfer learning property is applicable to such biological image sets.},

   abstract = {Background: The Allen Mouse Brain Atlas allows study of the brain's molecular anatomy at cellular scale, for thousands genes. To fully leverage this resource, one must register histological images of brain tissue – a task made challenging by the brain's structural complexity and heterogeneity, as well as inter-experiment variability. New method: We have developed a deep-learning based methodology for classification and registration of thousands of sections of brain tissue, using the mouse olfactory bulb (OB) as a case study. Results: We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to derive an image similarity measure for in-situ hybridization experiments, and embedded these in a low-dimensional feature space to guide the design of registration templates. We then compiled a high quality, registered atlas of gene expression for the OB (the first such atlas for the OB, to our knowledge). As proof-of-principle, the atlas was clustered using non-negative matrix factorization to reveal canonical expression motifs, and to identify novel, lamina-specific marker genes. Comparison with existing methods: Our method leverages virtues of CNNs for a set of important problems in molecular neuroanatomy, with performance comparable to existing methods. Conclusion: The atlas we have complied allows for intra- and inter-laminar comparisons of gene expression patterns in the OB across thousands of genes, as well identification of canonical expression profiles through clustering. We anticipate that this will be a useful resource for investigators studying the bulb's development and functional topography. Our methods are publicly available for those interested in extending them to other brain areas.},

   abstract = {Reverse engineering of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is a central task in systems biology. Most of the existing methods for GRN inference rely on gene co-expression analysis or TF-target binding information, where the determination of co-expression is often unreliable merely based on gene expression levels, and the TF-target binding data from high-throughput experiments may be noisy, leading to a high ratio of false links and missed links, especially for large-scale networks. In recent years, the microscopy images recording spatial gene expression have become a new resource in GRN reconstruction, as the spatial and temporal expression patterns contain much abundant gene interaction information. Till now, the spatial expression resources have been largely underexploited, and only a few traditional image processing methods have been employed in the image-based GRN reconstruction. Moreover, co-expression analysis using conventional measurements based on image similarity may be inaccurate, because it is the local-pattern consistency rather than global-image-similarity that determines gene-gene interactions. Here we present GripDL (Gene regulatory interaction prediction via Deep Learning), which incorporates high-confidence TF-gene regulation knowledge from previous studies, and constructs GRNs for Drosophila eye development based on Drosophila embryonic gene expression images. Benefitting from the powerful representation ability of deep neural networks and the supervision information of known interactions, the new method outperforms traditional methods with a large margin and reveals new intriguing knowledge about Drosophila eye development.},

Computational analysis of these patterns is made possible by genome-scale mapping of the C57BL/6J mouse brain in the Allen Brain Atlas. Here we describe methodology used to explore the spatial structure of gene expression patterns across a set of 3041 genes chosen on the basis of consistency across experimental observations (N = 2). The analysis was performed on smoothed, co-registered 3D expression volumes for each gene obtained by aggregating cellular resolution image data. Following dimensionality and noise reduction, voxels were clustered according to similarity of expression across the gene set. We illustrate the resulting parcellations of the mouse brain for different numbers of clusters (K) and quantitatively compare these parcellations with a classically-defined anatomical reference atlas at different levels of granularity, revealing a high degree of correspondence. These observations suggest that spatial localization of gene expression offers substantial promise in connecting knowledge at the molecular level with higher-level information about brain organization. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {To characterize gene expression patterns in the regional subdivisions of the mammalian brain, we integrated spatial gene expression patterns from the Allen Brain Atlas for the adult mouse with panels of cell type-specific genes for neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes frompreviously published transcriptome profiling experiments. We found that the combined spatial expression patterns of 170 neuron-specific transcripts revealed strikingly clear and symmetrical signatures for most of the brain's major subdivisions. Moreover, the brain expression spatial signatures correspond to anatomical structures and may even reflect developmental ontogeny. Spatial expression profiles of astrocyte-and oligodendrocyte-specific genes also revealed regional differences; these defined fewer regions and were less distinct but still symmetrical in the coronal plane. Follow-up analysis suggested that region-based clustering of neuron-specific genes was related to (i) a combination of individual genes with restricted expression patterns, (ii) region-specific differences in the relative expression of functional groups of genes, and (iii) regional differences in neuronal density. Products from some of these neuron-specific genes are present in peripheral blood, raising the possibility that they could reflect the activities of disease-or injury-perturbed networks and collectively function as biomarkers for clinical disease diagnostics.},

   abstract = {Background: Site-specific transcription factors (TFs) bind DNA regulatory elements to control expression of target genes, forming the core of gene regulatory networks. Despite decades of research, most studies focus on only a small number of TFs and the roles of many remain unknown. Results: We present a systematic characterization of spatiotemporal gene expression patterns for all known or predicted Drosophila TFs throughout embryogenesis, the first such comprehensive study for any metazoan animal. We generated RNA expression patterns for all 708 TFs by in situ hybridization, annotated the patterns using an anatomical controlled vocabulary, and analyzed TF expression in the context of organ system development. Nearly all TFs are expressed during embryogenesis and more than half are specifically expressed in the central nervous system. Compared to other genes, TFs are enriched early in the development of most organ systems, and throughout the development of the nervous system. Of the 535 TFs with spatially restricted expression, 79% are dynamically expressed in multiple organ systems while 21% show single-organ specificity. Of those expressed in multiple organ systems, 77 TFs are restricted to a single organ system either early or late in development. Expression patterns for 354 TFs are characterized for the first time in this study. Conclusions: We produced a reference TF dataset for the investigation of gene regulatory networks in embryogenesis, and gained insight into the expression dynamics of the full complement of TFs controlling the development of each organ system. © 2013 Hammonds et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {Background: Cell and tissue specific gene expression is a defining feature of embryonic development in multi-cellular organisms. However, the range of gene expression patterns, the extent of the correlation of expression with function, and the classes of genes whose spatial expression are tightly regulated have been unclear due to the lack of an unbiased, genome-wide survey of gene expression patterns. Results: We determined and documented embryonic expression patterns for 6,003 (44%) of the 13,659 protein-coding genes identified in the Drosophila melanogaster genome with over 70,000 images and controlled vocabulary annotations. Individual expression patterns are extraordinarily diverse, but by supplementing qualitative in situ hybridization data with quantitative microarray time-course data using a hybrid clustering strategy, we identify groups of genes with similar expression. Of 4,496 genes with detectable expression in the embryo, 2,549 (57%) fall into 10 clusters representing broad expression patterns. The remaining 1,947 (43%) genes fall into 29 clusters representing restricted expression, 20% patterned as early as blastoderm, with the majority restricted to differentiated cell types, such as epithelia, nervous system, or muscle. We investigate the relationship between expression clusters and known molecular and cellular-physiological functions. Conclusion: Nearly 60% of the genes with detectable expression exhibit broad patterns reflecting quantitative rather than qualitative differences between tissues. The other 40% show tissue-restricted expression; the expression patterns of over 1,500 of these genes are documented here for the first time. Within each of these categories, we identified clusters of genes associated with particular cellular and developmental functions. © 2007 Tomancak et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {Increased information on the encoded mammalian genome is expected to facilitate an integrated understanding of complex anatomical structure and function based on the knowledge of gene products. Determination of gene expression-anatomy associations is crucial for this understanding. To elicit the association in the three-dimensional (3D) space, we introduce a novel technique for comprehensive mapping of endogenous gene expression into a web-accessible standard space: Transcriptome Tomography. The technique is based on conjugation of sequential tissue-block sectioning, all fractions of which are used for molecular measurements of gene expression densities, and the block- face imaging, which are used for 3D reconstruction of the fractions. To generate a 3D map, tissues are serially sectioned in each of three orthogonal planes and the expression density data are mapped using a tomographic technique. This rapid and unbiased mapping technique using a relatively small number of original data points allows researchers to create their own expression maps in the broad anatomical context of the space. In the first instance we generated a dataset of 36,000 maps, reconstructed from data of 61 fractions measured with microarray, covering the whole mouse brain (ViBrism: http://vibrism.riken.jp/3dviewer/ex/index.html) in one month. After computational estimation of the mapping accuracy we validated the dataset against existing data with respect to the expression location and density. To demonstrate the relevance of the framework, we showed disease related expression of Huntington's disease gene and Bdnf. Our tomographic approach is applicable to analysis of any biological molecules derived from frozen tissues, organs and whole embryos, and the maps are spatially isotropic and well suited to the analysis in the standard space (e.g. Waxholm Space for brain-atlas databases). This will facilitate research creating and using open-standards for a molecular-based understanding of complex structures; and will contribute to new insights into a broad range of biological and medical questions. © 2012 Okamura-Oho et al.},

The network of polonies connected by shared borders forms a graph whose topology can be reconstructed from pairs of barcodes fused during a polony crosslinking phase, the sequences of which are determined by recovery from the surface and next-generation (next-gen) sequencing. We developed a mathematical and computational framework for this principle called polony adjacency reconstruction for spatial inference and topology and show that Euclidean spatial data may be stored and transmitted in the form of graph topology. Images are formed by transferring molecular information from a surface of interest, which we demonstrated in silico by reconstructing images formed from stochastic transfer of hypothetical molecular markers. The theory developed here could serve as a basis for an automated, multiplexable, and potentially superresolution imaging method based purely on molecular information.},

   abstract = {Background: Thorough understanding of complex model systems requires the characterisation of processes in different cell types of an organism. This can be achieved with high-throughput spatial transcriptomics at a large scale. However, for plant model systems this is still challenging as suitable transcriptomics methods are sparsely available. Here we present GaST-seq (Grid-assisted, Spatial Transcriptome sequencing), an easy to adopt, micro-scale spatial-transcriptomics workflow that allows to study expression profiles across small areas of plant tissue at a fraction of the cost of existing sequencing-based methods. Results: We compare the GaST-seq method with widely used library preparation methods (Illumina TruSeq). In spatial experiments we show that the GaST-seq method is sensitive enough to identify expression differences across a plant organ. We further assess the spatial transcriptome response of Arabidopsis thaliana leaves exposed to the bacterial molecule flagellin-22, and show that with eukaryotic (Albugo laibachii) infection both host and pathogen spatial transcriptomes are obtained. Conclusion: We show that our method can be used to identify known, rapidly flagellin-22 elicited genes, plant immune response pathways to bacterial attack and spatial expression patterns of genes associated with these pathways.},

   abstract = {Visualization of the transcriptome in situ has proven to be a valuable tool in exploring single-cell RNA-sequencing data, providing an additional dimension to investigate spatial cell typing and cell atlases, disease architecture or even data driven discoveries. The field of spatially resolved transcriptomic technologies is emerging as a vital tool to profile gene-expression, continuously pushing current methods to accommodate larger gene panels and larger areas without compromising throughput efficiency. Here, we describe a new version of the in situ sequencing (ISS) method based on padlock probes and rolling circle amplification. Modifications in probe design allows for a new barcoding system via sequence-by-hybridization chemistry for improved spatial detection of RNA transcripts. Due to the amplification of probes, amplicons can be visualized with standard epifluorescence microscopes with high-throughput efficiency and the new sequencing chemistry removes limitations bound by sequence-by-ligation chemistry of ISS. Here we present hybridization-based in situ sequencing (HybISS) that allows for increased flexibility and multiplexing, increased signal-to-noise, all without compromising throughput efficiency of imaging large fields of view. Moreover, the current protocol is demonstrated to work on human brain tissue samples, a source that has proven to be difficult to work with image-based spatial analysis techniques. Overall, HybISS technology works as a target amplification detection method for improved spatial transcriptomic visualization, and importantly, with an ease of implementation.},

Second, we integrate the spatial information of Slide-seq data with single-cell trajectory analysis tools to characterize the spatiotemporal development of the mouse neocortex.

However, the adaptation of each new method typically requires the setup of specific detection strategies or specialized instrumentation. A generic approach to spatially resolve different types of high throughput data is missing. Here, we describe an imaging-free framework to localize high throughput readouts within a tissue by combining compressive sampling and image reconstruction. We implemented this framework to transform a low-input RNA sequencing protocol into an imaging-free spatial transcriptomics technique (STRP-seq) and validated this method with a transcriptome profiling of the murine brain. To verify the broad applicability of STRP-seq, we applied the technique on the brain of the Australian bearded dragon Pogona vitticeps. Our results reveal the molecular anatomy of the telencephalon of this lizard, providing evidence for a marked regionalization of the reptilian pallium and subpallium.

   abstract = {Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues are a valuable resource for diagnosis and research. PCR is one of the most powerful methods of retrospective analysis of the DNA present in fixed tissues. One major problem with the molecular analysis of tissue samples, however, is cellular heterogeneity, ie, the large variety of cell types usually present in these specimens can mask cell-specific genetic alterations associated with disease. Herein we describe a procedure for obtaining and analyzing single cells recovered from stained histologic tissue sections without risking contamination from neighboring cells. An ultraviolet laser microbeam was used to physically destroy the tissue surrounding the single cells of interest. These cells, now freed from adjacent cells, were then easily retrieved with a motorized, computer-controlled micromanipulator and molecularly characterized through the use of PCR-based microanalysis. This accurate microdissection technique, followed by DNA amplification and direct sequencing, revealed a novel mutation in the gene coding for the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin in single tumor cells that was absent in the adjacent single epithelial cells of a patient with early gastric cancer of the diffuse type. In this form of malignancy, tumor cells lose homophilic cell-to-cell interactions and invade the connective tissue as single cells. E-cadherin gene mutations have previously been detected in advanced diffuse-type gastric cancer and gastric carcinoma cell lines. The present study suggests that E-cadherin gene mutations may be an early event in gastric tumorigenesis. The laser-based isolation and subsequent molecular characterization of individual cells, as described herein, allows for micrometer-sized precision and should prove useful in detecting the nucleic acid abnormalities that underlie cancer, infection, and genetic disease.},

Previously identified bulk expression subtypes were influenced by contaminating stroma and have not yet informed clinical management, whereas single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) of fresh tumors under-represented key cell types. Here, we developed a robust single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) technique for frozen archival PDAC specimens and used it to study both untreated tumors and those that received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy (CRT). Gene expression programs learned across untreated malignant cell and fibroblast profiles uncovered a clinically relevant molecular taxonomy with improved prognostic stratification compared to prior classifications. Moreover, in the increasingly-adopted neoadjuvant treatment context, there was a depletion of classical-like phenotypes in malignant cells in favor of basal-like phenotypes associated with TNF-NFkB and interferon signaling as well as the presence of novel acinar and neuroendocrine classical-like states, which may be more resilient to cytotoxic treatment. Spatially-resolved transcriptomics revealed an association between malignant cells expressing these basal-like programs and higher immune infiltration with increased lymphocytic content, whereas those exhibiting classical-like programs were linked to sparser macrophage-predominant microniches, perhaps pointing to susceptibility to distinct therapeutic strategies. Our refined molecular taxonomy and spatial resolution can help advance precision oncology in PDAC through informative stratification in clinical trials and insights into differential therapeutic targeting leveraging the immune system.

A custom-designed 22,000 oligonucleotide array was used in the present study to compare the gene expression profile of colonic epithelial cells isolated by laser capture microdissection from FFPE-archived samples with that of the same cell population from matched frozen samples, the preferred source of RNA. Total RNA was extracted from FFPE tissues, amplified, and labeled using the Paradise Reagent System. The quality of the input RNA was assessed by the Bioanalyzer profile, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and agarose gel electrophoresis. The results demonstrate that it is possible to obtain reliable microarray data from FFPE samples using RNA acquired by laser capture microdissection. The concordance between matched FFPE and frozen samples was evaluated and expressed as a Pearson's correlation coefficient, with values ranging from 0.80 to 0.97. The presence of ribosomal RNA peaks in FFPE-derived RNA was reflected by a high correlation with paired frozen samples. A set of practical recommendations for evaluating the RNA integrity and quality in FFPE samples is reported.

   abstract = {Objectives: Adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) is an intermediate step in the progression of normal lung tissue to invasive adenocarcinoma. However, molecular mechanisms underlying this progression remain to be fully elucidated due to challenges in obtaining fresh clinical samples for downstream analyses. Formalin fixation and paraffin embedding (FFPE) is a tissue preservation system widely used for long-term storage. Until recently, challenges in working with FFPE precluded using new RNA sequencing technologies (RNA-seq), which would help clarify key pathways in cancer progression. Also, isolation techniques including laser-capture micro-dissection provide the ability to select histopathologically distinct tissues, allowing researchers to study transcriptional variations between tightly juxtaposed cell and tissue types. Materials and methods: Utilizing these technologies and new alignment tools we examined differential expression of long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) and mRNAs across normal, AIS and invasive adenocarcinoma samples from six patients to identify possible markers of lung cancer progression. Results: RNA extracted and sequenced from these 18 samples generated an average of 198 million reads per sample. After alignment and filtering, uniquely aligned reads represented an average 35% of the total reads. We detected differential expression of a number of lincRNAs and mRNAs when comparing normal to AIS, or AIS to invasive adenocarcinoma. Of these, 5 lincRNAs and 31 mRNAs were consistently up- or down-regulated from normal to AIS and more so to invasive carcinoma. We validated the up-regulation of two mRNAs and one lincRNA by RT-qPCR as proof of principle. Conclusion: Our findings indicate a potential role of not only mRNAs, but also lincRNAs in the progression to invasive adenocarcinoma. We anticipate that these findings will lay the groundwork for future experimental studies of candidate RNAs from FFPE to identify their functional roles in lung cancer. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

   abstract = {RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a sensitive and accurate method for quantifying gene expression. Small samples or those whose RNA is degraded, such as formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, remain challenging to study with nonspecialized RNA-seq protocols. Here, we present a new method, Smart-3SEQ, that accurately quantifies transcript abundance even with small amounts of total RNA and effectively characterizes small samples extracted by laser-capture microdissection (LCM) from FFPE tissue. We also obtain distinct biological profiles from FFPE single cells, which have been impossible to study with previous RNA-seq protocols, and we use these data to identify possible new macrophage phenotypes associated with the tumor microenvironment. We propose Smart-3SEQ as a highly cost-effective method to enable large gene expression profiling experiments unconstrained by sample size and tissue availability. In particular, Smart-3SEQ's compatibility with FFPE tissue unlocks an enormous number of archived clinical samples; combined with LCM it allows unprecedented studies of small cell populations and single cells isolated by their in situ context.},

   abstract = {A mammalian brain is comprised of numerous cell types organized in an intricate manner to form functional neural circuits. Single-cell RNA sequencing provides a powerful approach to identify cell types based on their gene expression profiles and has revealed many distinct cell populations in the brain1-3. Single-cell epigenomic profiling4,5 further provides information on gene-regulatory signatures of different cell types. Understanding how different cell types contribute to brain function, however, requires knowledge of their spatial organization and connectivity, which is not preserved in sequencing-based methods that involve cell dissociation3,6. Here, we used an in situ single-cell transcriptome-imaging method, multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH)7, to generate a molecularly defined and spatially resolved cell atlas of the mouse primary motor cortex (MOp). We profiled ∼300,000 cells in the MOp, identified 95 neuronal and non-neuronal cell clusters, and revealed a complex spatial map in which not only excitatory neuronal clusters but also most inhibitory neuronal clusters adopted layered organizations. Notably, intratelencephalic (IT) cells, the largest branch of neurons in the MOp, formed a continuous spectrum of cells with gradual changes in both gene expression profiles and cortical depth positions in a highly correlated manner. Furthermore, we integrated MERFISH with retrograde tracing to probe the projection targets for different MOp neuronal cell types and found that projections of MOp neurons to other cortical regions formed a many-to-many network with each target region receiving input preferentially from a different composition of IT clusters. Overall, our results provide a high-resolution spatial and projection map of molecularly defined cell types in the MOp. We anticipate that the imaging platform described here can be broadly applied to create high-resolution cell atlases of a wide range of systems.Competing Interest StatementX.

As pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas usually contain a low proportion of cancer cells in the tumor mass, we prepared 95% pure populations of pancreatic cancer cells by means of laser microbeam microdissection, and compared their expression profiles to those of similarly purified, normal pancreatic ductal cells. We identified 260 genes that were commonly upregulated and 346 genes that were downregulated in pancreatic cancer cells. Because of the high degree of purity in the cell populations, a large proportion of genes that we detected as upregulated or downregulated in pancreatic cancers were different from those reported in previous studies. Comparison of clinicopathological parameters with the expression profiles indicated that altered expression of 76 genes was associated with lymph-node metastasis and that of 168 genes with liver metastasis. In addition, expression levels of 30 genes were related to the recurrence of disease. These genome-wide expression profiles should provide useful information for finding candidate genes whose products might serve as specific tumor markers and/or as molecular targets for treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer.},

Here, we use laser capture microdissection coupled with RNA sequencing to analyze single isolated SNc and VTA dopamine neurons in a large human cohort. By applying a unique iterative random pooling algorithm, with high utility to resolve differences across any two populations, we reveal 33 dopamine population-specific markers We also define the minimal cohort size required to identify these stably differentially expressed genes, explaining inconsistent results from previous studies. Finally, we identify human transcripts, including ZCCHC12, CDH13 and SERPINE2, that faithfully classify SNc or VTA dopamine neurons also in the mouse. The novel markers identified will be vital for future studies aiming to validate the identity of stem cell-derived dopamine neurons or to induce dopamine neuron resilience.},

In developing cerebral cortex, transcriptional differences are found between different proliferative and post-mitotic layers, wherein laminar signatures reflect cellular composition and developmental processes. Cytoarchitectural differences between human and mouse have molecular correlates, including species differences in gene expression in subplate, although surprisingly we find minimal differences between the inner and outer subventricular zones even though the outer zone is expanded in humans. Both germinal and post-mitotic cortical layers exhibit fronto-temporal gradients, with particular enrichment in the frontal lobe. Finally, many neurodevelopmental disorder and human-evolution-related genes show patterned expression, potentially underlying unique features of human cortical formation.

Gene expression changes more rapidly before birth, both in progenitor cells and maturing neurons.

Disparate cell populations exhibit distinct developmental timing of gene expression, but also unexpected synchrony of processes underlying neural circuit construction including cell projection and adhesion. Candidate risk genes for neurodevelopmental disorders including primary microcephaly, autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, and schizophrenia show disease-specific spatiotemporal enrichment within developing neocortex.

Using microarrays, 40 voxel images for 9000 genes were acquired from brains of both normal mice and mice in which a pharmacological model of Parkinson's disease (PD) had been induced by methamphetamine. Quality-control analyses established the reproducibility of the voxelation procedure. The investigation revealed a common network of coregulated genes shared between the normal and PD brain, and allowed identification of putative control regions responsible for these networks. In addition, genes involved in cell/cell interactions were found to be prominently regulated in the PD brains. Finally, singular value decomposition (SVD), a mathematical method used to provide parsimonious explanations of complex data sets, identified gene vectors and their corresponding images that distinguished between normal and PD brain structures, most pertinently the striatum.

Here, we combined the unique sample retrieval capacity afforded by laser capture microscopy with analysis of mRNA abundance by CEL-Seq (cell expression by linear amplification and sequencing) to generate a spatiotemporal gene expression map of the Caenorhabditis elegans syncytial germline from adult hermaphrodites and males. We found that over 6000 genes exhibit spatiotemporally dynamic expression patterns throughout the hermaphrodite germline, with two dominant groups of genes exhibiting reciprocal shifts in expression at late pachytene during meiotic prophase I. We found a strong correlation between restricted spatiotemporal expression and known developmental and cellular processes, indicating that these gene expression changes may be an important driver of germ cell progression. Analysis of the male gonad revealed a shift in gene expression at early pachytene and upregulation of subsets of genes following the meiotic divisions, specifically in early and late spermatids, mostly transcribed from the X chromosome. We observed that while the X chromosome is silenced throughout the first half of the gonad, some genes escape this control and are highly expressed throughout the germline. Although we found a strong correlation between the expression of genes corresponding to CSR-1-interacting 22G-RNAs during germ cell progression, we also found that a large fraction of genes may bypass the need for CSR-1-mediated germline licensing. Taken together, these findings suggest the existence of mechanisms that enable a shift in gene expression during prophase I to promote germ cell progression.},

In situ imaging of transcripts and proteins is the gold-standard, but it is difficult and time consuming to apply to an entire genome, even when highly automated. Sequencing, in contrast, is fast and genome-wide, but is generally applied to homogenized tissues, thereby discarding spatial information. To take advantage of the efficiency and comprehensiveness of sequencing while retaining spatial information, we cryosectioned individual blastoderm stage Drosophila melanogaster embryos along the anterior-posterior axis and developed methods to reliably sequence the mRNA isolated from each 25 μm slice. The spatial patterns of gene expression we infer closely match patterns previously determined by in situ hybridization and microscopy. We applied this method to generate a genome-wide timecourse of spatial gene expression from shortly after fertilization through gastrulation. We identified numerous genes with spatial patterns that have not yet been described in the several ongoing systematic in situ based projects. This simple experiment demonstrates the potential for combining careful anatomical dissection with high-throughput sequencing to obtain spatially resolved gene expression on a genome-wide scale. © 2013 Combs, Eisen.},

To explore these maps, we have developed computational methods for discovering region and tissue-specific genes. Moreover, by combining pattern-based analysis with differential gene expression analysis, we have found extensive sex-specific gene expression differences in the germline and sperm. We have also identified genes that are specifically expressed in the male reproductive tract, including a group of uncharacterized genes that encode small secreted proteins that are required for male fertility. We conclude that spatial gene expression maps provide a powerful resource for identifying novel tissue-specific gene functions in C. elegans.

Here we used tomo-seq to obtain a genome-wide gene expression signature with high spatial resolution spanning from the infarcted area to the remote to identify new regulators of cardiac remodeling. Cardiac tissue samples from patients suffering from ischemic heart disease were used to validate our findings. Results: Tracing transcriptional differences with a high spatial resolution across the infarcted heart enabled us to identify gene clusters that share a comparable expression profile. The spatial distribution patterns indicated a separation of expressional changes for genes involved in specific aspects of cardiac remodeling, such as fibrosis, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and calcium handling (Col1a2, Nppa, and Serca2). Subsequent correlation analysis allowed for the identification of novel factors that share a comparable transcriptional regulation pattern across the infarcted tissue. The strong correlation between the expression levels of these known marker genes and the expression of the coregulated genes could be confirmed in human ischemic cardiac tissue samples. Follow-up analysis identified SOX9 as common transcriptional regulator of a large portion of the fibrosis-related genes that become activated under conditions of ischemic injury. Lineage-tracing experiments indicated that the majority of COL1-positive fibroblasts stem from a pool of SOX9-expressing cells, and in vivo loss of Sox9 blunted the cardiac fibrotic response on ischemic injury. The colocalization between SOX9 and COL1 could also be confirmed in patients suffering from ischemic heart disease. Conclusions: Based on the exact local expression cues, tomo-seq can serve to reveal novel genes and key transcription factors involved in specific aspects of cardiac remodeling. Using tomo-seq, we were able to unveil the unknown relevance of SOX9 as a key regulator of cardiac fibrosis, pointing to SOX9 as a potential therapeutic target for cardiac fibrosis.},

   abstract = {Spatial patterning of gene expression is a key process in development, yet how it evolves is still poorly understood. Both cis- and trans-acting changes could participate in complex interactions, so to isolate the cis-regulatory component of patterning evolution, we measured allele-specific spatial gene expression patterns in D. melanogaster × simulans hybrid embryos. RNA-seq of cryo-sectioned slices revealed 66 genes with strong spatially varying allele-specific expression. We found that hunchback, a major regulator of developmental patterning, had reduced expression of the D. simulans allele specifically in the anterior tip of hybrid embryos. Mathematical modeling of hunchback cis-regulation suggested a candidate transcription factor binding site variant, which we verified as causal using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. In sum, even comparing morphologically near-identical species we identified surprisingly extensive spatial variation in gene expression, suggesting not only that development is robust to many such changes, but also that natural selection may have ample raw material for evolving new body plans via changes in spatial patterning.},

Specific diameter of the disposable capillary unit (DCU) and precisely regulated short vacuum impulse ensure collection of the desired tissue regions and even individual cells. We demonstrated that CTAS is capable of dissecting specific regions of live and frozen mouse and rat brain tissues at the cellular resolution with high accuracy. CTAS based microdissection avoids potentially harmful physical treatment of tissues such as chemical treatment, laser irradiation, excessive heat or mechanical cell damage, thus preserving primary functions and activities of the dissected cells and tissues. High quality DNA, RNA, and protein can be isolated from CTAS-dissected samples, which are suitable for sequencing, microarray, 2D gel-based proteomic analyses, and Western blotting. We also demonstrated that CTAS can be used to isolate cells from native living tissues for subsequent recultivation of primary cultures without affecting cellular viability, making it a simple and cost-effective alternative for laser-assisted microdissection. © 2012 Kudo et al.},

We studied the immunity network response conditioned by the potato Ny-1 gene against potato virus Y. We analyzed the processes in the cell death zone and surrounding tissue on the biochemical and gene expression levels to reveal spatiotemporal regulation of immune response. We show that the transcriptional response in the cell death zone and surrounding tissue is dependent on salicylic acid (SA). For some genes, spatiotemporal regulation is completely lost in SA-deficient line, while the others show different response, indicating multiple connections between hormonal signaling modules. The induction of NADPH oxidase RBOHD expression occurs specifically on the lesion border during resistance response. In plants with silenced RBOHD, the functionality of resistance response is perturbed and virus spread is not arrested at the site of infection. RBOHD is required for spatial accumulation of SA, and conversely RBOHD is under transcriptional regulation of SA. Using spatially resolved RNA-Seq, we also identified spatial regulation of an UDP-glucosyltransferase, another component in feedback activation of SA biosynthesis, thus deciphering a novel aspect of resistance signaling.},

   abstract = {Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) involve highly combinatorial interactions between transcription factors and short sequence motifs in cis-regulatory modules of target genes to control cellular phenotypes. The GRNs specifying most cell types are largely unknown and are the subject of wide interest. A catalog of transcription factors is a valuable tool toward obtaining a deeper understanding of the role of these critical effectors in any biological setting. Here we present a comprehensive catalog of the transcription factors for the diploid frog Xenopus tropicalis. We identify 1235 genes encoding DNA-binding transcription factors, comparable to the numbers found in typical mammalian species. In detail, the repertoire of X. tropicalis transcription factor genes is nearly identical to human and mouse, with the exception of zinc finger family members, and a small number of species/lineage-specific gene duplications and losses relative to the mammalian repertoires. We applied this resource to the identification of transcription factors differentially expressed in the early gastrula stage embryo. We find transcription factor enrichment in Spemann's organizer, the ventral mesoderm, ectoderm and endoderm, and report 218 TFs that show regionalized expression patterns at this stage. Many of these have not been previously reported as expressed in the early embryo, suggesting thus far unappreciated roles for many transcription factors in the GRNs regulating early development. We expect our transcription factor catalog will facilitate myriad studies using Xenopus as a model system to understand basic biology and human disease.},

Here, we use Xenopus laevis embryos to analyze the spatial and temporal transcriptome of distinct ectodermal domains in the course of neurulation, during the establishment of cell lineages. In order to define the transcriptome of small groups of cells from a single germ layer and to retain spatial information, dorsal and ventral ectoderm was subdivided along the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axes by microdissections. Principal component analysis on the transcriptomes of these ectoderm fragments primarily identifies embryonic axes and temporal dynamics. This provides a genetic code to define positional information of any ectoderm sample along the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes directly from its transcriptome. In parallel, we use nonnegative matrix factorization to predict enhanced gene expression maps onto early and mid-neurula embryos, and specific signatures for each ectoderm area. The clustering of spatial and temporal datasets allowed detection of multiple biologically relevant groups (e.g., Wnt signaling, neural crest development, sensory placode specification, ciliogenesis, germ layer specification). We provide an interactive network interface, EctoMap, for exploring synexpression relationships among genes expressed in the neurula, and suggest several strategies to use this comprehensive dataset to address questions in developmental biology as well as stem cell or cancer research.},

   abstract = {Divergence of gene function and expression during development can give rise to phenotypic differences at the level of cells, tissues, organs, and ultimately whole organisms. To gain insights into the evolution of gene expression and novel genes at spatial resolution, we compared the spatially-resolved transcriptomes of two distantly related nematodes, Caenorhabditis elegans and Pristionchus pacificus, that diverged 60-90 million years ago.The spatial transcriptomes of adult worms show little evidence for strong conservation at the level of single genes. Instead, regional expression is largely driven by recent duplication and emergence of novel genes. Estimation of gene ages across anatomical structures revealed an enrichment of novel genes in sperm-related regions. This provides first evidence in nematodes for the” out of testis” hypothesis that has been previously postulated based on studies in Drosophila and mammals. “Out of testis” genes represent a mix of products of pervasive transcription as well as fast evolving members of ancient gene families. Strikingly, numerous novel genes have known functions during meiosis in C. elegans indicating that even universal processes such as meiosis may be targets of rapid evolution. Our study highlights the importance of novel genes in generating phenotypic diversity and explicitly characterizes gene origination in sperm-related regions. Furthermore, it proposes new functions for previously uncharacterized genes and establishes the spatial transcriptome of P. pacificus as a catalog for future studies on the evolution of gene expression and function.},

   abstract = {Laser capture microdissection (LCM) is increasingly being used in quantitative gene expression studies of the nervous system. The current study aimed at determining the impact of various tissue manipulations on the integrity of extracted RNA in LCM studies. Our data indicate that various tissue preparation strategies prior to microdissection may decrease RNA quality by as much as 25%, thus affecting expression profiles of some genes. To circumvent this problem, we developed a strategy for reverse transcriptase real-time PCR that has considerable sensitivity and can be used to calculate relative changes in gene expression. This approach was validated in subregions of the rat cerebellum. Accordingly, expression of glial gene markers - myelin-associated glycoprotein and proteolipid protein 1 - was found 70-160-fold higher in the white matter layer of the cerebellar cortex as compared to the neuron-enriched granular layer. In contrast, expression of a specific neuronal maker, neuron-specific enolase, was found seven-fold higher in the granular layer, as compared to the white matter layer. Furthermore, this approach had high sensitivity and specificity as we were able to detect a 38% decrease in the expression of neuron-specific enolase without a change in the expression of glial markers following administration of the neurotoxin, ibotenic acid. These results demonstrate feasibility of performing accurate semi-quantitative gene expression analyses in LCM samples. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Herein, we demonstrate multicolor stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) based on a multi-parameter detection strategy, which uses both the fluorescence activation wavelength and the emission color to discriminate between photo-activatable fluorescent probes. First, we obtained two-color super-resolution images using the near-infrared cyanine dye Alexa 750 in conjunction with a red cyanine dye Alexa 647, and quantified color crosstalk levels and image registration accuracy. Combinatorial pairing of these two switchable dyes with fluorophores which enhance photo-activation enabled multi-parameter detection of six different probes. Using this approach, we obtained six-color super-resolution fluorescence images of a model sample.

Early exposure of dendritic cells to type I interferon (IFN), which occurred during infection with VSV, induced production of the cytokine IL-6 and drove TFH cell polarization, whereas late exposure to type I IFN, which occurred during infection with LCMV, did not induce IL-6 and allowed differentiation into TH1 cells.

This disparity is especially notable when considering the abundance of RNA biomarkers discovered through whole-genome expression profiling. This is largely due to the high degree of technical complexity and insufficient sensitivity and specificity of current RNA ISH techniques. Here, we describe RNAscope, a novel RNA ISH technology with a unique probe design strategy that allows simultaneous signal amplification and background suppression to achieve single-molecule visualization while preserving tissue morphology. RNAscope is compatible with routine formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens and can use either conventional chromogenic dyes for bright-field microscopy or fluorescent dyes for multiplex analysis. Unlike grind-and-bind RNA analysis methods such as real-time RT-PCR, RNAscope brings the benefits of in situ analysis to RNA biomarkers and may enable rapid development of RNA ISH-based molecular diagnostic assays. © 2012 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the Association for Molecular Pathology.

However, it frequently proves difficult to use such short DNA segments to identify clones in genomic libraries or fragments in blots of the whole genome or for in situ analysis of chromosomes. Oligonucleotide probes, consisting of two target-complementary segments, connected by a linker sequence, were designed. Upon recognition of the specific nucleic acid molecule the ends of the probes were joined through the action of a ligase, creating circular DNA molecules catenated to the target sequence. These probes thus provide highly specific detection with minimal background.},

Given the selective value of such repeats, it is likely that several different mechanisms have been responsible for their generation. One mechanism that has been shown to generate relatively long tandem repeats (in the kilobase range) is rolling circle replication. In this communication, we demonstrate that rolling circle synthesis in a simple enzymatic system can produce tandem repeats of monomers as short as 34 bp. In addition to suggesting possible origins for natural tandem repeats, these observations provide a facile means for constructing libraries of repeated motifs for use in 'in vitro evolution' experiments designed to select molecules with defined biological or chemical properties.},

   abstract = {Circularizing oligonucleotide probes (padlock probes) have the potential to detect sets of gene sequences with high specificity and excellent selectivity for sequence variants, but sensitivity of detection has been limiting. By using a rolling circle replication (RCR) mechanism, circularized but not unreacted probes can yield a powerful signal amplification. We demonstrate here that in order for the reaction to proceed efficiently, the probes must be released from the topological link that forms with target molecules upon hybridization and ligation. If the target strand has a nearby free 3' end, then the probe-target hybrids can be displaced by the polymerase used for replication. The displaced probe can then slip off the target strand and a rolling circle amplification is initiated. Alternatively, the target sequence itself can prime an RCR after its non-base paired 3' end has been removed by exonucleolytic activity. We found the Φ29 DNA polymerase to be superior to the Klenow fragment in displacing the target DNA strand, and it maintained the polymerization reaction for at least 12 h, yielding an extension product that represents several thousand-fold the length of the padlock probe.},

   abstract = {Rolling-circle amplification (RCA) driven by DNA polymerase can replicate circularized oligonucleotide probes with either linear or geometric kinetics under isothermal conditions. In the presence of two primers, one hybridizing to the + strand, and the other, to the -strand of DNA, a complex pattern of DNA strand displacement ensues that generates 109 or more copies of each circle in 90 minutes, enabling detection of point mutations in human genomic DNA. Using a single primer, RCA generates hundreds of tandemly linked copies of a covalently closed circle in a few minutes. If matrix-associated, the DNA product remains bound at the site of synthesis, where it may be tagged, condensed and imaged as a point light source. Linear oligonucleotide probes bound covalently on a glass surface can generate RCA signals, the colour of which indicates the allele status of the target, depending on the outcome of specific, target-directed ligation events. As RCA permits millions of individual probe molecules to be counted and sorted using colour codes, it is particularly amenable for the analysis of rare somatic mutations. RCA also shows promise for the detection of padlock probes bound to single-copy genes in cytological preparations.},

   abstract = {Background: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in diverse biological processes. In contrast to extensive genomic annotation of lncRNA transcripts, far fewer have been characterized for subcellular localization and cell-to-cell variability. Addressing this requires systematic, direct visualization of lncRNAs in single cells at single-molecule resolution. Results: We use single-molecule RNA-FISH to systematically quantify and categorize the subcellular localization patterns of a representative set of 61 lncRNAs in three different cell types. Our survey yields high-resolution quantification and stringent validation of the number and spatial positions of these lncRNA, with an mRNA set for comparison. Using this highly quantitative image-based dataset, we observe a variety of subcellular localization patterns, ranging from bright sub-nuclear foci to almost exclusively cytoplasmic localization. We also find that the low abundance of lncRNAs observed from cell population measurements cannot be explained by high expression in a small subset of 'jackpot' cells. Additionally, nuclear lncRNA foci dissolve during mitosis and become widely dispersed, suggesting these lncRNAs are not mitotic bookmarking factors. Moreover, we see that divergently transcribed lncRNAs do not always correlate with their cognate mRNA, nor do they have a characteristic localization pattern. Conclusions: Our systematic, high-resolution survey of lncRNA localization reveals aspects of lncRNAs that are similar to mRNAs, such as cell-to-cell variability, but also several distinct properties. These characteristics may correspond to particular functional roles. Our study also provides a quantitative description of lncRNAs at the single-cell level and a universally applicable framework for future study and validation of lncRNAs.},

   abstract = {Motivation: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.Results: To align our large (>80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of >50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy. © The Author(s) 2012.

   abstract = {Intrathymic T cell development converts multipotent precursors to committed pro-T cells, silencing progenitor genes while inducing T cell genes, but the underlying steps have remained obscure. Single-cell profiling was used to define the order of regulatory changes, employing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) for full-transcriptome analysis, plus sequential multiplexed single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (seqFISH) to quantitate functionally important transcripts in intrathymic precursors. Single-cell cloning verified high T cell precursor frequency among the immunophenotypically defined “early T cell precursor” (ETP) population; a discrete committed granulocyte precursor subset was also distinguished. We established regulatory phenotypes of sequential ETP subsets, confirmed initial co-expression of progenitor with T cell specification genes, defined stage-specific relationships between cell cycle and differentiation, and generated a pseudotime model from ETP to T lineage commitment, supported by RNA velocity and transcription factor perturbations. This model was validated by developmental kinetics of ETP subsets at population and clonal levels. The results imply that multilineage priming is integral to T cell specification.},

Multiple genome architectures at different length scales, including chromatin loops, domains, compartments, and lamina- and nucleolus-associated regions, have been discovered. However, how these structures are arranged in the same cell and how they are mutually correlated in different cell types in mammalian tissue are largely unknown. Here, we develop Multiplexed Imaging of Nucleome Architectures that measures multiscale chromatin folding, copy numbers of numerous RNA species, and associations of numerous genomic regions with nuclear lamina, nucleoli and surface of chromosomes in the same, single cells. We apply this method in mouse fetal liver, and identify de novo cell-type-specific chromatin architectures associated with gene expression, as well as cell-type-independent principles of chromatin organization. Polymer simulation shows that both intra-chromosomal self-associating interactions and extra-chromosomal interactions are necessary to establish the observed organization. Our results illustrate a multi-faceted picture and physical principles of chromatin organization.},

   abstract = {Biological tissues contain thousands of different proteins yet conventional antibody staining can only assay a few at a time because of the limited number of spectrally distinct fluorescent labels. The capacity to map the location of hundreds or thousands of proteins within a single sample would allow for an unprecedented investigation of the spatial proteome, and give insight into the development and function of diseased and healthy tissues. In order to achieve this goal, we propose a new technology that leverages established methodologies for in situ imaging of nucleic acids to achieve near limitless multiplexing. The exponential scaling power of DNA technologies ties multiplexing to the number of DNA nucleotides sequenced rather than the number of spectrally distinct labels. Here we demonstrate that barcode sequencing can be applied to in situ proteomics by sequencing DNA conjugated antibodies bound to biological samples. In addition, we show a signal amplification method which is compatible with barcoded antibodies.

We quantified several mRNA targets with either singleplex SYBR Green I or dualplex probe-based reverse transcription real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), with the latter used to calculate the correlation between quantification cycles (Cqs) of mRNA targets amplified in the same realtime quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay. Results: RT efficiency is enzyme, sample, RNA concentration, and assay dependent and can lead to variable correlation between mRNAs from the same sample. This translates into relative mRNA expression levels that generally vary between 2-and 3-fold, although higher levels are also observed. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that the variability of the RT step is sufficiently large to call into question the validity of many published data that rely on quantification of cDNA. Variability can be minimized by choosing an appropriate RTase and high concentrations of RNA and characterizing the variability of individual assays by use of multiple RT replicates. Background: The reverse transcription (RT) of RNA to cDNA is a necessary first step for numerous research and molecular diagnostic applications. Although RT efficiency is known to be variable, little attention has been paid to the practical implications of that variability.},

In order to characterize the gene expression of periodontitis-affected gingival tissue, we have here simultaneously quantified and localized gene expression in periodontal tissue using spatial transcriptomics, combining RNA sequencing with histological analysis. Our analyses revealed distinct clusters of gene expression, which were identified to correspond to epithelium, inflamed areas of connective tissue, and non-inflamed areas of connective tissue. Moreover, 92 genes were identified as significantly up-regulated in inflamed areas of the gingival connective tissue compared to non-inflamed tissue. Among these, immunoglobulin lambda-like polypeptide 5 (IGLL5), signal sequence receptor subunit 4 (SSR4), marginal zone B and B1 cell specific protein (MZB1), and X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) were the four most highly up-regulated genes. These genes were also verified as significantly higher expressed in gingival tissue of patients with periodontitis compared to healthy controls, using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Moreover, the protein expressions of up-regulated genes were verified in gingival biopsies by immunohistochemistry. In summary, in this study, we report distinct gene expression signatures within periodontitis-affected gingival tissue, as well as specific genes that are up-regulated in inflamed areas compared to non-inflamed areas of gingival tissue. The results obtained from this study may add novel information on the genes and cell types contributing to pathogenesis of the chronic inflammatory disease periodontitis.},

   abstract = {Lately it has become possible to analyze transcriptomic profiles in tissue sections with retained cellular context. We aimed to explore synovial biopsies from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis (SpA) patients, using Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) as a proof of principle approach for unbiased mRNA studies at the site of inflammation in these chronic inflammatory diseases. Synovial tissue biopsies from affected joints were studied with ST. The transcriptome data was subjected to differential gene expression analysis (DEA), pathway analysis, immune cell type identification using Xcell analysis and validation with immunohistochemistry (IHC). The ST technology allows selective analyses on areas of interest, thus we analyzed morphologically distinct areas of mononuclear cell infiltrates. The top differentially expressed genes revealed an adaptive immune response profile and T-B cell interactions in RA, while in SpA, the profiles implicate functions associated with tissue repair. With spatially resolved gene expression data, overlaid on high-resolution histological images, we digitally portrayed pre-selected cell types in silico. The RA displayed an overrepresentation of central memory T cells, while in SpA effector memory T cells were most prominent. Consequently, ST allows for deeper understanding of cellular mechanisms and diversity in tissues from chronic inflammatory diseases.},

   abstract = {Aims The mechanisms underlying the selective degeneration of motor neurones in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to implement spatially resolved RNA sequencing in human post mortem cortical tissue from an ALS patient harbouring the C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion to identify dysregulated transcripts that may account for differential vulnerabilities of distinct (i) cell types and (ii) brain regions in the pathogenesis of ALS. Methods Using spatial transcriptomics (ST) we analysed the transcriptome of post mortem brain tissue, with spatial resolution down to 100 ?m. Validation of these findings was then performed using BaseScope, an adapted, in situ hybridization technique with single-transcript single-cell-resolution, providing extensive regional and cell-type specific confirmation of these dysregulated transcripts. The validation cohort was then extended to include multiple post mortem brain regions and spinal cord tissue from an extended cohort of C9orf72, sporadic ALS (sALS) and SOD1 ALS cases. Results We identified sixteen dysregulated transcripts of proteins that have roles within six disease-related pathways. Furthermore, these complementary molecular pathology techniques converged to identify two spatially dysregulated transcripts, GRM3 and USP47, that are commonly dysregulated across sALS, SOD1 and C9orf72 cases alike. Conclusions This study presents the first description of ST in human post mortem cortical tissue from an ALS patient harbouring the C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion. These data taken together highlight the importance of preserving spatial resolution, facilitating the identification of genes whose dysregulation may in part underlie regional susceptibilities to ALS, crucially highlighting potential therapeutic and diagnostic targets.},

Interactions between motor neurons and glia contribute to motor neuron loss, but the spatiotemporal ordering of molecular events that drive these processes in intact spinal tissue remains poorly understood. Here, we use spatial transcriptomics to obtain gene expression measurements of mouse spinal cords over the course of disease, as well as of postmortem tissue from ALS patients, to characterize the underlying molecular mechanisms in ALS. We identify pathway dynamics, distinguish regional differences between microglia and astrocyte populations at early time points, and discern perturbations in several transcriptional pathways shared between murine models of ALS and human postmortem spinal cords.},

   abstract = {Summary To define the cellular composition and architecture of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), we combined single-cell RNA sequencing with spatial transcriptomics and multiplexed ion beam imaging from a series of human cSCCs and matched normal skin. cSCC exhibited four tumor subpopulations, three recapitulating normal epidermal states, and a tumor-specific keratinocyte (TSK) population unique to cancer, which localized to a fibrovascular niche. Integration of single-cell and spatial data mapped ligand-receptor networks to specific cell types, revealing TSK cells as a hub for intercellular communication. Multiple features of potential immunosuppression were observed, including T regulatory cell (Treg) co-localization with CD8 T cells in compartmentalized tumor stroma. Finally, single-cell characterization of human tumor xenografts and in vivo CRISPR screens identified essential roles for specific tumor subpopulation-enriched gene networks in tumorigenesis. These data define cSCC tumor and stromal cell subpopulations, the spatial niches where they interact, and the communicating gene networks that they engage in cancer.},

Hence, novel biomarkers, such as fetal marker genes with low expression levels, could potentially differentiate disease states in order to improve therapy.

This study examines such spatial variations within and between regions of cardiac biopsies. In contrast to standard RNA sequencing, this approach provides a spatially resolved transcriptome- and tissue-wide perspective of the adult human heart, and enables detection of fetal marker genes expressed by minor subpopulations of cells within the tissue. Analysis of patients with heart failure, with preserved ejection fraction, demonstrated spatially divergent expression of fetal genes in cardiac biopsies.},

   abstract = {Alternative RNA splicing varies across brain regions, but the single-cell resolution of such regional variation is unknown. Here we present the first single-cell investigation of differential isoform expression (DIE) between brain regions, by performing single cell long-read transcriptome sequencing in the mouse hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in 45 cell types at postnatal day 7 (www.isoformAtlas.com). Using isoform tests for brain-region specific DIE, which outperform exon-based tests, we detect hundreds of brain-region specific DIE events traceable to specific cell-types. Many DIE events correspond to functionally distinct protein isoforms, some with just a 6-nucleotide exon variant. In most instances, one cell type is responsible for brain-region specific DIE. Cell types indigenous to only one anatomic structure display distinctive DIE, where for example, the choroid plexus epithelium manifest unique transcription start sites. However, for some genes, multiple cell-types are responsible for DIE in bulk data, indicating that regional identity can, although less frequently, override cell-type specificity. We validated our findings with spatial transcriptomics and long-read sequencing, yielding the first spatially resolved splicing map in the postnatal mouse brain (www.isoformAtlas.com). Our methods are highly generalizable. They provide a robust means of quantifying isoform expression with cell-type and spatial resolution, and reveal how the brain integrates molecular and cellular complexity to serve function.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

   abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been regarded as potential biomarkers in early diagnosis of cancer. Since the high sequence similarity among miRNA family members, biosensing miRNAs with single-base resolution is still a challenge, particularly when the different base is located at the terminal of miRNA. Herein, we developed two real-time fluorescence monitoring methods for miRNA detection utilizing efficient PBCV-1 DNA ligase mediated target miRNA dependent DNA ligation, followed by rolling circle signal amplification. Compared to duplex-specific nuclease (DSN) enhanced rolling circle transcription (RCT) system, nicking endonuclease (NEase) assisted rolling circle amplification (PRCA-NESA) can provide higher amplification efficiency, and achieve a limit-of-detection of 0.5 amol for miR-17 in 10 μL sample. More importantly, benefiting from the unique characteristics of PBCV-1 DNA ligase, we designed an asymmetric PRCA-NESA method, which can greatly discriminate the single-base difference at either 5′- or 3′-terminals of miRNAs. MiR-17 from various tumor cells also can be reliably detected. In conclusion, our strategy exploited the application potential of PBCV-1 DNA ligase in biosensing, and provided a new idea to highly specific miRNA detection, thereby would possess a promising potential for further application in biomedical research and early cancer diagnosis.},

The closed-circular dumbbell-shaped padlock DNA was designed to be complementary to its corresponding target miRNA. In the presence of the target miRNA, a long stretch of ssDNA with tandem G-quadruplex sequence repeats was readily generated by RCA, initiated by phi29 DNA polymerase through DNA synthesis priming at the 3′-OH of the target miRNA annealed to the padlock DNA. The RCA product harboring tandem G-quadruplex was monitored with fluorophore Thioflavin T (ThT) that emits strong fluorescence only when it intercalates into the G-quadruplex. The GQ-RCA assay enabled us to detect miRNA as low as 4.9 fM with a linear range from 25.6 fM to 80 pM within 0.5 h. In addition, our system was applied to the miRNA samples present in human plasma, showing its potential use in the clinical diagnosis of cancer.},

We show that deep learning is more accurate, requires less time to curate segmentation results, can segment multiple cell types, and can distinguish between different cell lines present in the same image. We highlight specific design rules that enable us to achieve high segmentation accuracy even with a small number of manually annotated images (~100 cells).

RNA localization is mediated by specific cis-regulatory elements usually found in mRNA 3′UTRs. Therefore, processes that generate alternative 3′UTRs—alternative splicing and polyadenylation—have the potential to diversify mRNA localization patterns in neurons. Here, we performed mapping of alternative 3′UTRs in neurites and soma isolated from mESC-derived neurons. Our analysis identified 593 genes with differentially localized 3′UTR isoforms. In particular, we have shown that two isoforms of Cdc42 gene with distinct functions in neuronal polarity are differentially localized between neurites and soma of mESC-derived and mouse primary cortical neurons, at both mRNA and protein level. Using reporter assays and 3′UTR swapping experiments, we have identified the role of alternative 3′UTRs and mRNA transport in differential localization of alternative CDC42 protein isoforms. Moreover, we used SILAC to identify isoform-specific Cdc42 3′UTR-bound proteome with potential role in Cdc42 localization and translation. Our analysis points to usage of alternative 3′UTR isoforms as a novel mechanism to provide for differential localization of functionally diverse alternative protein isoforms.},

Simulation results show that leveraging existing cell type taxonomy increases RNA assignment accuracy by more than 45%. Using JSTA we were able to classify cells in the mouse hippocampus into 133 (sub)types revealing the spatial organization of CA1, CA3, and Sst neuron subtypes. Analysis of within cell subtype spatial differential gene expression of 80 candidate genes identified 43 with statistically significant spatial differential gene expression across 61 (sub)types. Overall, our work demonstrates that known cell type expression patterns can be leveraged to improve the accuracy of RNA hybridization based spatial transcriptomics while providing highly granular cell (sub)type information. The large number of newly discovered spatial gene expression patterns substantiates the need for accurate spatial transcriptomics measurements that can provide information beyond cell (sub)type labels.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

   abstract = {Spatial transcriptomics is an emerging stack of technologies, which adds spatial dimension to conventional single-cell RNA-sequencing. New protocols, based on in situ sequencing or multiplexed RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization register positions of single molecules in fixed tissue slices. Analysis of such data at the level of individual cells, however, requires accurate identification of cell boundaries. While many existing methods are able to approximate cell center positions using nuclei stains, current protocols do not report robust signal on the cell membranes, making accurate cell segmentation a key barrier for downstream analysis and interpretation of the data. To address this challenge, we developed a tool for Bayesian Segmentation of Spatial Transcriptomics Data (Baysor), which optimizes segmentation considering the likelihood of transcriptional composition, size and shape of the cell. The Bayesian approach can take into account nuclear or cytoplasm staining, however can also perform segmentation based on the detected transcripts alone. We show that Baysor segmentation can in some cases nearly double the number of the identified cells, while reducing contamination. Importantly, we demonstrate that Baysor performs well on data acquired using five different spatially-resolved protocols, making it a useful general tool for analysis of high-resolution spatial data.Competing Interest StatementP.V.K serves on the Scientific Advisory Board to Celsius Therapeutics, Inc.

To annotate the precise cellular composition of distinct tissue regions, we introduce a method for multimodal intersection analysis. Applying multimodal intersection analysis to primary pancreatic tumors, we find that subpopulations of ductal cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and cancer cells have spatially restricted enrichments, as well as distinct coenrichments with other cell types. Furthermore, we identify colocalization of inflammatory fibroblasts and cancer cells expressing a stress-response gene module.

We created an atlas of the diverse cellular lineages in developing hearts, their spatial organization, and their interactions during development. Spatial mapping of differentiation transitions revealed the intricate interplay between cellular differentiation and morphogenesis in cardiac cellular lineages. Using spatially resolved expression analysis, we identified anatomically restricted gene expression programs.

In this study, we aim to develop a novel informatics approach which can reconstruct whole and various tissues/organs in silico. As the first step of this project, we conducted single-cell transcriptome analysis of 38 individual cells obtained from two mouse blastocysts (E3.5d) and tried to reconstruct blastocyst structures in 3D. In reconstruction step, each cell position is estimated by 3D principal component analysis and expression profiles of cell adhesion genes as well as other marker genes. In addition, we also proposed a reconstruction method without using marker gene information.

Although very informative, in standard scRNAseq experiments, the spatial organization of the cells in the tissue of origin is lost. Conversely, spatial RNA-seq technologies designed to maintain cell localization have limited throughput and gene coverage. Mapping scRNAseq to genes with spatial information increases coverage while providing spatial location. However, methods to perform such mapping have not yet been benchmarked. To fill this gap, we organized the DREAM Single-Cell Transcriptomics challenge focused on the spatial reconstruction of cells from the Drosophila embryo from scRNAseq data, leveraging as silver standard, genes with in situ hybridization data from the Berkeley Drosophila Transcription Network Project reference atlas. The 34 participating teams used diverse algorithms for gene selection and location prediction, while being able to correctly localize clusters of cells. Selection of predictor genes was essential for this task. Predictor genes showed a relatively high expression entropy, high spatial clustering and included prominent developmental genes such as gap and pair-rule genes and tissue markers. Application of the top 10 methods to a zebra fish embryo dataset yielded similar performance and statistical properties of the selected genes than in the Drosophila data. This suggests that methods developed in this challenge are able to extract generalizable properties of genes that are useful to accurately reconstruct the spatial arrangement of cells in tissues.},

To validate spatially predicted enhancers, we use a large collection of enhancer?reporter lines and identify ~ 85% of enhancers in which chromatin accessibility and enhancer activity are coupled. Next, we infer enhancer-to-gene relationships in the virtual space, finding that genes are mostly regulated by multiple, often redundant, enhancers. Exploiting cell type-specific enhancers, we deconvolute cell type-specific effects of bulk-derived chromatin accessibility QTLs. Finally, we discover that Prospero drives neuronal differentiation through the binding of a GGG motif. In summary, we provide a comprehensive spatial characterization of gene regulation in a 2D tissue.},

   abstract = {The mammalian liver performs key physiological functions for maintaining energy and metabolic homeostasis. Liver tissue is both spatially structured and temporally orchestrated. Hepatocytes operate in repeating anatomical units termed lobules and different lobule zones perform distinct functions. The liver is also subject to extensive temporal regulation, orchestrated by the interplay of the circadian clock, systemic signals and feeding rhythms. Liver zonation was previously analyzed as a static phenomenon and liver chronobiology at the tissue level. Here, we use single-cell RNA-seq to investigate the interplay between gene regulation in space and time. Categorizing mRNA expression profiles using mixed-effect models and smFISH validations, we find that many genes in the liver are both zonated and rhythmic, most of them showing multiplicative space-time effects. Such dually regulated genes cover key hepatic functions such as lipid, carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, but also genes not previously associated with liver zonation such as chaperones. Our data also suggest that rhythmic and localized expression of Wnt targets could be explained by rhythmically expressed Wnt ligands from non-parenchymal cells near the central vein. Core circadian clock genes are expressed in a non-zonated manner, indicating that the liver clock is robust to zonation. Together, our comprehensive scRNA-seq analysis revealed how liver function is compartmentalized spatio-temporally at the sub-lobular scale.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Using partial information decomposition, we next compute the intercellular gene–gene information flow to estimate the spatial regulations between genes across cells.

   abstract = {High-throughput spatial-transcriptomics RNA sequencing (sptRNA-seq) based on in-situ capturing technologies has recently been developed to spatially resolve transcriptome-wide mRNA expressions mapped to the captured locations in a tissue sample. One major limitation of in-situ capturing is the high dropout rate of mRNAs that fail the capture or the amplification, which leads to incomplete profiling of the gene expressions. In this paper, we introduce a graph-regularized tensor completion model for imputing the missing mRNA expressions in sptRNA-seq data, namely FIST, Fast Imputation of Spatially-resolved transcriptomes by graph-regularized Tensor completion. We first model sptRNA-seq data as a 3-way sparse tensor in genes (p-mode) and the (x, y) spatial coordinates (x-mode and y-mode) of the observed gene expressions, and then consider the imputation of the unobserved entries as a tensor completion problem in Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) form. To improve the imputation of highly sparse sptRNA-seq data, we also introduce a protein-protein interaction network to add prior knowledge of gene functions, and a spatial graph to capture the the spatial relations among the capture spots. The tensor completion model is then regularized by a Cartesian product graph of protein-protein interaction network and the spatial graph to capture the high-order relations in the tensor. In the experiments, FIST was tested on ten 10x Genomics Visium spatial transcriptomic datasets of different tissue sections with cross-validation among the known entries in the imputation. FIST significantly outperformed several best performing single-cell RNAseq data imputation methods. We also demonstrate that both the spatial graph and PPI network play an important role in improving the imputation. In a case study, we further analyzed the gene clusters obtained from the imputed gene expressions to show that the imputations by FIST indeed capture the spatial characteristics in the gene expressions and reveal functions that are highly relevant to three different kinds of tissues in mouse kidney. The source code and data are available at https://github.com/kuanglab/FIST.Author summary Biological tissues are composed of different types of structurally organized cell units playing distinct functional roles. The exciting new spatial gene expression profiling methods have enabled the analysis of spatially resolved transcriptomes to understand the spatial and functional characteristics of these cells in the context of eco-environment of tissue. Similar to single-cell RNA sequencing data, spatial transcriptomics data also suffers from a high dropout rate of mRNAs in in-situ capture. Our method, FIST (Fast Imputation of Spatially-resolved transcriptomes by graph-regularized Tensor completion), focuses on the spatial and high-sparsity nature of spatial transcriptomics data by modeling the data as a 3-way gene-by-(x, y)-location tensor and a product graph of a spatial graph and a protein-protein interaction network. Our comprehensive evaluation of FIST on ten 10x Genomics Visium spatial genomics datasets and comparison with the methods for single-cell RNA sequencing data imputation demonstrate that FIST is a better method more suitable for spatial gene expression imputation. Overall, we found FIST a useful new method for analyzing spatially resolved gene expressions based on novel modeling of spatial and functional information.},

   abstract = {Charting a biological atlas of an organ, such as the brain, requires us to spatially-resolve whole transcriptomes of single cells, and to relate such cellular features to the histological and anatomical scales. Single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-Seq (sc/snRNA-seq) can map cells comprehensively5,6, but relating those to their histological and anatomical positions in the context of an organ’s common coordinate framework remains a major challenge and barrier to the construction of a cell atlas7–10. Conversely, Spatial Transcriptomics allows for in-situ measurements11–13 at the histological level, but at lower spatial resolution and with limited sensitivity. Targeted in situ technologies1–3 solve both issues, but are limited in gene throughput which impedes profiling of the entire transcriptome. Finally, as samples are collected for profiling, their registration to anatomical atlases often require human supervision, which is a major obstacle to build pipelines at scale. Here, we demonstrate spatial mapping of cells, histology, and anatomy in the somatomotor area and the visual area of the healthy adult mouse brain. We devise Tangram, a method that aligns snRNA-seq data to various forms of spatial data collected from the same brain region, including MERFISH1, STARmap2, smFISH3, and Spatial Transcriptomics4 (Visium), as well as histological images and public atlases. Tangram can map any type of sc/snRNA-seq data, including multi-modal data such as SHARE-seq data5, which we used to reveal spatial patterns of chromatin accessibility. We equipped Tangram with a deep learning computer vision pipeline, which allows for automatic identification of anatomical annotations on histological images of mouse brain. By doing so, Tangram reconstructs a genome-wide, anatomically-integrated, spatial map of the visual and somatomotor area with ∼30,000 genes at single-cell resolution, revealing spatial gene expression and chromatin accessibility patterning beyond current limitation of in-situ technologies.Competing Interest StatementAR is a co-founder and equity holder of Celsius Therapeutics, an equity holder in Immunitas, and was an SAB member of ThermoFisher Scientific, Syros Pharmaceuticals, Neogene Therapeutics and Asimov.

   abstract = {Motivation The negative binomial distribution is a good model for counts data from both bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Gaussian process (GP) regression provides a useful non-parametric approach for modeling temporal or spatial changes in gene expression. However, currently available GP regression methods that implement negative binomial likelihood models do not scale to the increasingly large datasets being produced by single-cell and spatial transcriptomics.Results The GPcounts package implements GP regression methods for modelling counts data using negative binomial likelihood functions. Computational efficiency is achieved through the use of variational Bayesian inference. The GP function models changes in the mean of the negative binomial likelihood through a logarithmic link function and the dispersion parameter is fitted by maximum likelihood. We also provide the option of modelling additional dropout using a zero-inflated negative binomial likelihood. We validate the method on simulated time course data, showing that it is better able to identify changes in over-dispersed counts data than methods based on Gaussian or Poisson likelihoods. To demonstrate temporal inference, we apply GPcounts to single-cell RNA-seq datasets after pseudotime and branching inference. To demonstrate spatial inference, we apply GPcounts to data from the mouse olfactory bulb to identify spatially variable genes and compare to a published GP method with a Gaussian likelihood function. Our results show that GPcounts can be used to model temporal and spatial counts data in cases where simpler Gaussian and Poisson likelihoods are unrealistic.Availability GPcounts is implemented using the GPflow library in Python and is available at https://github.com/ManchesterBioinference/GPcounts along with the data, code and notebooks required to reproduce the results presented here.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

   abstract = {Spatial Transcriptomics is an emerging technology that adds spatial dimensionality and tissue morphology to the genome-wide transcriptional profile of cells in an undissociated tissue. Integrating these three types of data creates a vast potential for deciphering novel biology of cell types in their native morphological context. Here we developed innovative integrative analysis approaches to utilise all three data types to first find cell types, then reconstruct cell type evolution within a tissue, and search for tissue regions with high cell-to-cell interactions. First, for normalisation of gene expression, we compute a distance measure using morphological similarity and neighbourhood smoothing. The normalised data is then used to find clusters that represent transcriptional profiles of specific cell types and cellular phenotypes. Clusters are further sub-clustered if cells are spatially separated. Analysing anatomical regions in three mouse brain sections and 12 human brain datasets, we found the spatial clustering method more accurate and sensitive than other methods. Second, we introduce a method to calculate transcriptional states by pseudo-space-time (PST) distance. PST distance is a function of physical distance (spatial distance) and gene expression distance (pseudotime distance) to estimate the pairwise similarity between transcriptional profiles among cells within a tissue. We reconstruct spatial transition gradients within and between cell types that are connected locally within a cluster, or globally between clusters, by a directed minimum spanning tree optimisation approach for PST distance. The PST algorithm could model spatial transition from non-invasive to invasive cells within a breast cancer dataset. Third, we utilise spatial information and gene expression profiles to identify locations in the tissue where there is both high ligand-receptor interaction activity and diverse cell type co-localisation. These tissue locations are predicted to be hotspots where cell-cell interactions are more likely to occur. We detected tissue regions and ligand-receptor pairs significantly enriched compared to background distribution across a breast cancer tissue. Together, these three algorithms, implemented in a comprehensive Python software stLearn, allow for the elucidation of biological processes within healthy and diseased tissues.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

We show that BayesSpace improves the identification of transcriptionally distinct tissues from spatial transcriptomics samples of the brain, of melanoma, and of squamous cell carcinoma. In particular, BayesSpace’s improved resolution allows the identification of tissue structure that is not detectable at the original resolution and thus not recovered by other methods. Using an in silico dataset constructed from scRNA-seq, we demonstrate that BayesSpace can spatially resolve expression patterns to near single-cell resolution without the need for external single-cell sequencing data.

The availability of high throughput spatial expression data opens the door to methods that can infer such interactions both within and between cells. However, the spatial data also raises several new challenges. These include issues related to the sparse, noisy expression vectors for each cell, the fact that several different cell types are often profiled, the definition of a neighborhood of cell and the relatively small number of extracellular interactions. To enable the identification of gene interactions between cells we extended a Graph Convolutional Neural network approach for Genes (GCNG). We encode the spatial information as a graph and use the network to combine it with the expression data using supervised training. Testing GCNG on spatial transcriptomics data we show that it improves upon prior methods suggested for this task and can propose novel pairs of extracellular interacting genes. Finally, we show that the output of GCNG can also be used for down-stream analysis including functional assignment.Supporting website with software and data: https://github.com/xiaoyeye/GCNG.},

Here, we tackle this problem through a new framework of multicellular programs: combinations of distinct cellular programs in different cell types that are coordinated together in the tissue, thus forming a higher order functional unit at the tissue, rather than only cell, level. We develop the open-access DIALOGUE algorithm to systematically uncover such multi-cellular programs not only from spatial data, but even from tissue dissociated and profiled as single cells, e.g., by single-cell RNA-Seq. Tested on spatial transcriptomes from the mouse hypothalamus, DIALOGUE recovered spatial information, predicted the properties of a cell’s environment only based on its transcriptome, and identified multicellular programs that mark animal behavior. Applied to brain samples and colon biopsies profiled by scRNA-Seq, DIALOGUE identified multicellular configurations that mark Alzheimer’s disease and ulcerative colitis (UC), including a program spanning five cell types that is predictive of response to anti-TNF therapy in UC patients and enriched for UC risk genes from GWAS, each acting in different cell types, but all cells acting in concert.

   abstract = {Noise in gene expression renders cells more adaptable to changing environment by imposing phenotypic and functional heterogeneity on genetically identical individual cells. Hence, quantitative measurement of noise in gene expression is essential for the study of biological processes in cells. Currently, there are two complementary methods for quantitatively measuring noise in gene expression at the single cell level: single molecule FISH (smFISH) and single cell qRT-PCR (or single cell RNA-seq). While smFISH has been developed for culture cells, tissue sections and whole-mount invertebrate organisms, the method has not been reported for whole-mount vertebrate organisms. Here, we report an smFISH method that is suitable for whole-mount zebrafish embryo, a popular vertebrate model organism for the studies of development, physiology and disease. We show the detection of individual transcripts for several cell-type specific and ubiquitously expressed genes at the single cell level in whole-mount zebrafish embryo. We also demonstrate that the method can be adapted to detect two different genes in individual cells simultaneously. The whole-mount smFISH method described in this report is expected to facilitate the study of noise in gene expression and its role in zebrafish, a vertebrate animal model relevant to human biology.},

MESSI relies on multi-task learning using information from neighboring cells to improve the prediction of response genes within a cell. Applying the methods to three spatial single cell expression datasets, we show that MESSI accurately predicts the levels of response genes, improving upon prior methods and provides useful biological insights about key signaling genes and subtypes of excitatory neuron cells.MESSI is available at: https://github.com/doraadong/MESSISupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

We demonstrate the use of scHOT by studying coordinated changes in higher-order interactions during embryonic development of the mouse liver. Additionally, scHOT identifies subtle changes in gene–gene correlations across space using spatially resolved transcriptomics data from the mouse olfactory bulb. scHOT meaningfully adds to first-order differential expression testing and provides a framework for interrogating higher-order interactions using single-cell data.},

Single-cell RNA sequencing can reveal RNA abundance with high quantitative accuracy, sensitivity and throughput1. However, this approach captures only a static snapshot at a point in time, posing a challenge for the analysis of time-resolved phenomena such as embryogenesis or tissue regeneration. Here we show that RNA velocity—the time derivative of the gene expression state—can be directly estimated by distinguishing between unspliced and spliced mRNAs in common single-cell RNA sequencing protocols. RNA velocity is a high-dimensional vector that predicts the future state of individual cells on a timescale of hours. We validate its accuracy in the neural crest lineage, demonstrate its use on multiple published datasets and technical platforms, reveal the branching lineage tree of the developing mouse hippocampus, and examine the kinetics of transcription in human embryonic brain. We expect RNA velocity to greatly aid the analysis of developmental lineages and cellular dynamics, particularly in humans.},

   abstract = {Digital analysis of pathology whole-slide images is fast becoming a game changer in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Specifically, deep learning methods have shown great potential to support pathology analysis, with recent studies identifying molecular traits that were not previously recognized in pathology H&E whole-slide images. Simultaneous to these developments, it is becoming increasingly evident that tumor heterogeneity is an important determinant of cancer prognosis and susceptibility to treatment, and should therefore play a role in the evolving practices of matching treatment protocols to patients. State of the art diagnostic procedures, however, do not provide automated methods for characterizing and/or quantifying tumor heterogeneity, certainly not in a spatial context. Further, existing methods for analyzing pathology whole-slide images from bulk measurements require many training samples and complex pipelines. Our work addresses these two challenges. First, we train deep learning models to spatially resolve bulk mRNA and miRNA expression levels on pathology whole-slide images (WSIs). Our models reach up to 0.95 AUC on held-out test sets from two cancer cohorts using a simple training pipeline and a small number of training samples. Using the inferred gene expression levels, we further develop a method to spatially characterize tumor heterogeneity. Specifically, we produce tumor molecular cartographies and heterogeneity maps of WSIs and formulate a heterogeneity index (HTI) that quantifies the level of heterogeneity within these maps. Applying our methods to breast and lung cancer slides, we show a significant statistical link between heterogeneity and survival. Our methods potentially open a new and accessible approach to investigating tumor heterogeneity and other spatial molecular properties and their link to clinical characteristics, including treatment susceptibility and survival.},

The biotin was then detected by using an anti-biotin antibody and a rhodamine-conjugated second antibody. Alternatively, avidin conjugated to rhodamine or avidin complexed to biotinated peroxidase has been used for mRNA detection. The procedure described preserved morphological detail yet is compatible with hybridization conditions and reveals the disposition of actin mRNA during gene expression.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The application of the Gal4/UAS system to enhancer and gene trapping screens in zebrafish has greatly increased the ability to label and manipulate cell populations in multiple tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS). However the ability to select existing lines for specific applications has been limited by the lack of detailed expression analysis. RESULTS: We describe a Gal4 enhancer trap screen in which we used advanced image analysis, including three-dimensional confocal reconstructions and documentation of expression patterns at multiple developmental time points. In all, we have created and annotated 98 lines exhibiting a wide range of expression patterns, most of which include CNS expression. Expression was also observed in nonneural tissues such as muscle, skin epithelium, vasculature, and neural crest derivatives. All lines and data are publicly available from the Zebrafish International Research Center (ZIRC) from the Zebrafish Model Organism Database (ZFIN). CONCLUSIONS: Our detailed documentation of expression patterns, combined with the public availability of images and fish lines, provides a valuable resource for researchers wishing to study CNS development and function in zebrafish. Our data also suggest that many existing enhancer trap lines may have previously uncharacterized expression in multiple tissues and cell types.},

   abstract = {Author summary Manifold learning methods have emerged as a way of analyzing the large high-dimensional data sets that are currently generated in many areas of science. They assume the data has been sampled from an unknown manifold which is approximated with a graph and utilize spectral graph techniques to perform unsupervised feature selection and dimensionality reduction. However, graphs provide only partial approximations to manifolds, precluding the application to features with a complex combinatorial structure. Relatedly, these methods cannot take into account the topology of the manifold. In this work, we extend spectral methods for feature selection to topological spaces built from data and present a general framework for feature selection. We present specific applications of this framework to clustering-independent analysis of gene expression and multi-modal genomic data. In particular, using these methods, we perform differential expression analysis in situations where samples cannot be grouped into distinct classes, and we disaggregate the results according to topological features of the expression space. In addition, we identify genes with spatial patterns of expression using spatially-resolved transcriptomic data and establish associations between genetic alterations and global expression patterns in large cross-sectional cancer studies.},

   abstract = {Sleep deprivation (SD) leads to a suite of cognitive and behavioral impairments, and yet the molecular consequences of SD in the brain are poorly understood. Using a systematic immediate-early gene (IEG) mapping to detect neuronal activation, the consequences of SD were mapped primarily to forebrain regions. SD was found to both induce and suppress IEG expression (and thus neuronal activity) in subregions of neocortex, striatum, and other brain regions. Laser microdissection and cDNA microarrays were used to identify the molecular consequences of SD in seven brain regions. In situ hybridization (ISH) for 222 genes selected from the microarray data and other sources confirmed that robust molecular changes were largely restricted to the forebrain. Analysis of the ISH data for 222 genes (publicly accessible at http://sleep.alleninstitute.org) provided a molecular and anatomic signature of the effects of SD on the brain. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and the neocortex exhibited differential regulation of the same genes, such that in the SCN genes exhibited time-of-day effects while in the neocortex, genes exhibited only SD and waking (W) effects. In the neocortex, SD activated gene expression in areal-, layer-, and cell type-specific manner. In the forebrain, SD preferentially activated excitatory neurons, as demonstrated by double-labeling, except for striatum which consists primarily of inhibitory neurons. These data provide a characterization of the anatomical and cell type-specific signatures of SD on neuronal activity and gene expression that may account for the associated cognitive and behavioral effects.},

However, current approaches rely on dissociating cells from tissues, thereby losing the crucial spatial context that is necessary for understanding cell and tissue interactions during development. Here, we apply an image-based single-cell transcriptomics method, seqFISH, to simultaneously and precisely detect mRNA molecules for 387 selected target genes in 8-12 somite stage mouse embryo tissue sections. By integrating spatial context and highly multiplexed transcriptional measurements with two single-cell transcriptome atlases we accurately characterize cell types across the embryo and demonstrate how spatially-resolved expression of genes not profiled by seqFISH can be imputed. We use this high-resolution spatial map to characterize fundamental steps in the patterning of the midbrain-hindbrain boundary and the developing gut tube. Our spatial atlas uncovers axes of resolution that are not apparent from single-cell RNA sequencing data – for example, in the gut tube we observe early dorsal-ventral separation of esophageal and tracheal progenitor populations. In sum, by computationally integrating high-resolution spatially-resolved gene expression maps with single-cell genomics data, we provide a powerful new approach for studying how and when cell fate decisions are made during early mammalian development.Competing Interest StatementW.R. is a consultant and shareholder of Cambridge Epigenetix.

   abstract = {Identifying the relationships between chromosome structures, chromatin states, and gene expression is an overarching goal of nuclear organization studies. Because individual cells are highly variable at all three levels, it is essential to map all three modalities in the same single cell, a task that has been difficult to accomplish with existing tools. Here, we report the direct super-resolution imaging of over 3,660 chromosomal loci in single mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) by DNA seqFISH+, along with 17 chromatin marks by sequential immunofluorescence (IF) and the expression profile of 70 RNAs, in the same cells. We discovered that the nucleus is separated into zones defined by distinct combinatorial chromatin marks. DNA loci and nascent transcripts are enriched at the interfaces between specific nuclear zones, and the level of gene expression correlates with an association between active or nuclear speckle zones. Our analysis also uncovered several distinct mESCs subpopulations with characteristic combinatorial chromatin states that extend beyond known transcriptional states, suggesting that the metastable states of mESCs are more complex than previously appreciated. Using clonal analysis, we show that the global levels of some chromatin marks, such as H3K27me3 and macroH2A1 (mH2A1), are heritable over at least 3-4 generations, whereas other marks fluctuate on a faster time scale. The long- lived chromatin states may represent hidden variables that explain the observed functional heterogeneity in differentiation decisions in single mESCs. Our integrated spatial genomics approach can be used to further explore the existence and biological relevance of molecular heterogeneity within cell populations in diverse biological systems.Competing Interest StatementL.C. is a co-founder of Spatial Genomics Inc.},

Yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying the clinical manifestations of COVID-19, as well as what distinguishes them from common seasonal influenza virus and other lung injury states such as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), remains poorly understood. To address these challenges, we combined transcriptional profiling of 646 clinical nasopharyngeal swabs and 39 patient autopsy tissues, matched with spatial protein and expression profiling (GeoMx) across 357 tissue sections. These results define both body-wide and tissue-specific (heart, liver, lung, kidney, and lymph nodes) damage wrought by the SARS-CoV-2 infection, evident as a function of varying viral load (high vs. low) during the course of infection and specific, transcriptional dysregulation in splicing isoforms, T cell receptor expression, and cellular expression states. In particular, cardiac and lung tissues revealed the largest degree of splicing isoform switching and cell expression state loss. Overall, these findings reveal a systemic disruption of cellular and transcriptional pathways from COVID-19 across all tissues, which can inform subsequent studies to combat the mortality of COVID-19, as well to better understand the molecular dynamics of lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection and other viruses.Competing Interest StatementO.E. is scientific advisor and equity holder in Freenome, Owkin, Volastra Therapeutics and OneThree Biotech.

With this increased efficiency, we maintain specificity, multiplexing capabilities and ease of implementation. Overall, the dRNA chemistry shows significant improvements in target detection efficiency, closing the gap between the gold standard of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) based technologies and opens up possibilities to explore new biological questions previously not possible with cDNA-based ISS, nor with FISH.Competing Interest StatementMats Nilsson is co-founder of the company CARTANA which is commercializing in situ sequencing reagents.

   abstract = {Author summary Spatial transcriptomics technologies allow us to simultaneously detect multiple molecular targets in the context of intact tissues. These experiments yield images that answer two questions: which kinds of molecules are present, and where are they located in the tissue? In many experiments (e.g., mapping RNA expression in fine neuronal processes), it is desirable to increase the signal density relative to the imaging resolution. This may lead to mixing of signals from multiple RNA molecules into single imaging voxels; thus we need to demix the signals from these images. Here we introduce BarDensr, a new computational method to perform this demixing. The method is based on a forward model of the imaging process, followed by a convex optimization approach to approximately ‘invert’ mixing induced during imaging. This new approach leads to significantly improved performance in demixing imaging data with dense expression and/or low spatial resolution.},

   abstract = {In Situ Transcriptomics (IST) is a set of image-based transcriptomics approaches that enables localisation of gene expression directly in tissue samples. IST techniques produce multiplexed image series in which fluorescent spots are either present or absent across imaging rounds and colour channels. A spot’s presence and absence form a type of barcoded pattern that labels a particular type of mRNA. Therefore, the expression of a gene can be determined by localising the fluorescent spots and decode the barcode that they form. Existing IST algorithms usually do this in two separate steps: spot localisation and barcode decoding. Although these algorithms are efficient, they are limited by strictly separating the localisation and decoding steps. This limitation becomes apparent in regions with low signal-to-noise ratio or high spot densities. We argue that an improved gene expression decoding can be obtained by combining these two steps into a single algorithm. This allows for an efficient decoding that is less sensitive to noise and optical crowding.We present IST Decoding by Deconvolution (ISTDECO), a principled decoding approach combining spectral and spatial deconvolution into a single algorithm. We evaluate ISTDECO on simulated data, as well as on two real IST datasets, and compare with state-of-the-art. ISTDECO achieves state-of-the-art performance despite high spot densities and low signal-to-noise ratios.

Application to mouse embryos revealed major tissue types in early organogenesis as well as fine features like microvasculature in a brain and pigmented epithelium in an eye field. Gene expression profiles in 10-μm pixels conformed into the clusters of single-cell transcriptomes, allowing for rapid identification of cell types and spatial distributions.

Further leveraging such a relationship to train a coupled autoencoder, we demonstrated the prediction of single-cell gene expression profile evolution using long-term electrical measurement from the same cardiac patch or 3D millimeter-scale cardiac organoids. As exemplified by cardiac tissue maturation, in situ electro-seq will be broadly applicable to create spatiotemporal multimodal maps and predictive models in electrogenic organs, allowing discovery of cell types and gene programs responsible for electrophysiological function and dysfunction.Competing Interest StatementA patent application has been filed by Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard related to this work; all methods and protocols are freely available.},

   abstract = {High resolution in situ hybridization (ISH) images of the brain capture spatial gene expression at cellular resolution. These spatial profiles are key to understanding brain organization at the molecular level. Previously, manual qualitative scoring and informatics pipelines have been applied to ISH images to determine expression intensity and pattern. To better capture the complex patterns of gene expression in the human cerebral cortex, we applied a machine learning approach. We propose gene re-identification as a contrastive learning task to compute representations of ISH images. We train our model on a ISH dataset of ~1,000 genes obtained from postmortem samples from 42 individuals. This model reaches a gene re-identification rate of 38.3%, a 13x improvement over random chance. We find that the learned embeddings predict expression intensity and pattern. To test generalization, we generated embeddings in a second dataset that assayed the expression of 78 genes in 53 individuals. In this set of images, 60.2% of genes are re-identified, suggesting the model is robust. Importantly, this dataset assayed expression in individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia. Gene and donor-specific embeddings from the model predict schizophrenia diagnosis at levels similar to that reached with demographic information. Mutations in the most discriminative gene, SCN4B, may help understand cardiovascular associations with schizophrenia and its treatment. We have publicly released our source code, embeddings, and models to spur further application to spatial transcriptomics. In summary, we propose and evaluate gene re-identification as a machine learning task to represent ISH gene expression images.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

While various ‘atlas’ projects have collated some of the associated datasets, most questions related to specific tissue types, species or other attributes of studies require identifying papers through manual and challenging literature search. To facilitate discovery with published single-cell transcriptomics data, we have assembled a near exhaustive, manually curated database of single-cell transcriptomics studies with key information: descriptions of the type of data and technologies used, along with descriptors of the biological systems studied. Additionally, the database contains summarized information about analysis in the papers, allowing for analysis of trends in the field. As an example, we show that the number of cell types identified in scRNA-seq studies is proportional to the number of cells analysed.Database URL: www.nxn.se/single-cell-studies/gui},

Here we report a large-scale inactivation of the expressed genes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. For this purpose, we have established a high-throughput “RNAi-by-soaking” methodology by modifying the conventional RNAi method 1, 2. A set of tag-sequenced, nonredundant cDNAs corresponding to approximately 10,000 genes [3] (representing half of the predicted genes [4]) was used for the systematic RNAi analysis. We have processed approximately 2500 genes to date. In development, 27% of them showed detectable phenotypes, such as embryonic lethality, post-embryonic lethality, sterility, and morphological abnormality. Of these, we analyzed the phenotypes of F1 sterility in detail, and we have identified 24 genes that might play important roles in germline development. Combined with the ongoing analysis of expression patterns of these cDNAs 3, 5, the functional information obtained in this work will provide a starting point for the further analysis of each gene. Another finding from this screening is that the incidence of essential genes is significantly lower in the X chromosome than in the autosomes.},

Using sequencing-by-synthesis technology we directly sequenced the cytosine methylome (methylC-seq), transcriptome (mRNA-seq), and small RNA transcriptome (smRNA-seq) to generate highly integrated epigenome maps for wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana and mutants defective in DNA methyltransferase or demethylase activity. At single-base resolution we discovered extensive, previously undetected DNA methylation, identified the context and level of methylation at each site, and observed local sequence effects upon methylation state. Deep sequencing of smRNAs revealed a direct relationship between the location of smRNAs and DNA methylation, perturbation of smRNA biogenesis upon loss of CpG DNA methylation, and a tendency for smRNAs to direct strand-specific DNA methylation in regions of RNA-DNA homology. Finally, strand-specific mRNA-seq revealed altered transcript abundance of hundreds of genes, transposons, and unannotated intergenic transcripts upon modification of the DNA methylation state.},

Differential screening of cDNA libraries constructed from single sensory neurons from the rat VNO has led to the isolation of a family of about 30 putative receptor genes. Sequence analysis indicates that these genes comprise a novel family of seven transmembrane domain proteins unrelated to the receptors expressed in the MOE. Moreover, the expression of each member of the gene family is restricted to a small subpopulation of VNO neurons. These genes are likely to encode mammalian pheromone receptors.},

To address this problem, we developed a PCR-based technique to analyze the transcriptome of individual tumor cells isolated from the bone marrow of cancer patients.

The utility of this approach for understanding the biology of occult disseminated cells and for the identification of new therapeutic targets is demonstrated here by the detection of frequent extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN; CD147) expression which was verified by immunostaining.},

The RNA from defined single cells is amplified by microinjecting primer, nucleotides, and enzyme into acutely dissociated cells from a defined region of rat brain. Further processing yields amplified antisense RNA. A second round of amplification results in greater than 10(6)-fold amplification of the original starting material, which is adequate for analysis--e.g., use as a probe, making of cDNA libraries, etc. We demonstrate this method by constructing expression profiles of single live cells from rat hippocampus. This profiling suggests that cells that appear to be morphologically similar may show marked differences in patterns of expression. In addition, we characterize several mRNAs from a single cell, some of which were previously undescribed, perhaps due to &quot;rarity&quot; when averaged over many cell types. Electrophysiological analysis coupled with molecular biology within the same cell will facilitate a better understanding of how changes at the molecular level are manifested in functional properties. This approach should be applicable to a wide variety of studies, including development, mutant models, aging, and neurodegenerative disease.},

The expression and relative abundance of more than 18 000 messenger RNAs were assessed from EC layer II stellate neurons from postmortem samples of schizophrenic and age-matched control brains. Results of this initial screen were used to perform a more specific secondary messenger RNA screen for each subject.Data disclosed marked differences in expression of various G-protein–coupled receptor-signaling transcripts, glutamate receptor subunits, synaptic proteins, and other transcripts. Results of secondary screening showed significant decreases in levels of G-protein subunit iα1, glutamate receptor 3, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1, synaptophysin, and sensory nerve action potentials 23 and 25 in the stellate neurons of schizophrenic patients. We observed down-regulation of phospholemman (a phosphoprotein associated with anion channel formation) messenger RNA and protein levels in layer II/III stellate neurons in the population with schizophrenia.These results provide a preliminary expression profile of schizophrenia in defined neuronal populations.

Here we describe single-cell gene expression profiling of CA1 neurons in the rat hippocampus using a combination of laser capture, T7 RNA amplification, and cDNA microarray analysis. Subsequent cluster analysis of the microarray data identified two different cell types: pyramidal neurons and an interneuron. Cluster analysis also revealed differences among the pyramidal neurons, indicating that even a single cell type in vivo is not a homogeneous population of cells at the gene expression level. Microarray data were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. We also report on the reproducibility and sensitivity of this combination of methods. Single-cell gene expression profiling offers a powerful tool to tackle the complexity of the mammalian brain.},

This report describes a method to separate and clone individual messenger RNAs (mRNAs) by means of the polymerase chain reaction. The key element is to use a set of oligonucleotide primers, one being anchored to the polyadenylate tail of a subset of mRNAs, the other being short and arbitrary in sequence so that it anneals at different positions relative to the first primer. The mRNA subpopulations defined by these primer pairs were amplified after reverse transcription and resolved on a DNA sequencing gel. When multiple primer sets were used, reproducible patterns of amplified complementary DNA fragments were obtained that showed strong dependence on sequence specificity of either primer.},

   abstract = {A systems-level understanding of a small but essential population of cells in development or adulthood (e.g. somatic stem cells) requires accurate quantitative monitoring of genome-wide gene expression, ideally from single cells. We report here a strategy to globally amplify mRNAs from single cells for highly quantitative high-density oligonucleotide microarray analysis that combines a small number of directional PCR cycles with subsequent linear amplification. Using this strategy, both the representation of gene expression profiles and reproducibility between individual experiments are unambiguously improved from the original method, along with high coverage and accuracy. The immediate application of this method to single cells in the undifferentiated inner cell masses of mouse blastocysts at embryonic day (E) 3.5 revealed the presence of two populations of cells, one with primitive endoderm (PE) expression and the other with pluripotent epiblast-like gene expression. The genes expressed differentially between these two populations were well preserved in morphologically differentiated PE and epiblast in the embryos one day later (E4.5), demonstrating that the method successfully detects subtle but essential differences in gene expression at the single-cell level among seemingly homogeneous cell populations. This study provides a strategy to analyze biophysical events in medicine as well as in neural, stem cell and developmental biology, where small numbers of distinctive or diseased cells play critical roles.},

   abstract = {Phenotypic characterization of cells in conjunction with single-cell mRNA analysis, which yields information regarding expression of multiple genes in individual neurons, facilitates a detailed and comprehensive view of neuronal cell biology. More specifically, the aRNA amplification method has provided an approach to analyze mRNA levels in single cells that have been phenotypically characterized on the basis of electrophysiology, morphology, and/or protein expression. In this way, relative mRNA abundances can be directly assayed from a well-defined population of neurons. The concept of expression profiling led to the development of robotics methods for arraying thousands of cDNAs on microarrays. These cDNA arrays can be screened with labeled aRNA or cDNA to generate a molecular fingerprint of a specific cell type, disease state, or therapeutic efficacy. A broad view of how gene expression is altered in single neurons affected by a particular disease process may provide clues to pathogenetic disease mechanisms or avenues for therapeutic interventions. The use of mRNA profiles to produce diagnostics and therapeutics is called transcript-aided drug design (TADD)15,35,36. When coupled with single-cell resolution, TADD promises to be an important tool in diagnosis of disease states, as well as provide a blueprint on which to develop therapeutic strategies. For example, mRNA abundances in an individual diseased cell may increase, decrease, or remain constant, and thus it is possible that a pharmaceutical alone or in combination with other drugs may be specifically designed to restore mRNA abundances to a normal state. Alternatively, if functional protein levels parallel the mRNA level changes, then drugs targeting the function of the proteins translated from these altered mRNAs may prove to be therapeutic. One promise of such an approach is that information about mRNA abundances that are altered in a diseased cell may provide new therapeutic indications for existing drugs. For example, if the abundance of mRNA for the β-adrenergic receptor is altered as shown by the microarrays for a particular disease, already available adrenergic receptor agonists or antagonists that had not previously been used in this particular disease paradigm may prove to be therapeutically efficacious. The expression profile of a given cell is a measure of the potential for protein expression. Proteins are generally the functional entities within cells and differences in protein function often result in disease. The ability to monitor the coordinate changes in gene expression, in single phenotypically identified cells, that correlate with disease will provide unique insight into the expressed genetic variability of cells and will likely furnish unforeseen insight into the underlying cellular mechanisms that produce disease etiology.},

Here, we apply single cell RNA-sequencing and spatial analysis of malignant and adjacent non-malignant liver tissues from five patients with cholangiocarcinoma or liver metastases. We find that stromal cells exhibit recurring, patient-independent expression programs, and reconstruct a ligand?receptor map that highlights recurring tumor?stroma interactions. By combining transcriptomics of laser-capture microdissected regions, we reconstruct a zonation atlas of hepatocytes in the non-malignant sites and characterize the spatial distribution of each cell type across the tumor microenvironment. Our analysis provides a resource for understanding human liver malignancies and may expose potential points of interventions.},

   abstract = {Recently, we have found that defibrination of rats with Malayan pit viper venom induces a 10-38-fold increase in the levels of translatable fibrinogen mRNA in the liver. We have used this response to obtain cDNA clones for the three polypeptide chains of rat fibrinogen. A large cDNA library was created in pBR322 from induced rat liver polyadenylated RNA by the poly(dG, dC)-tailing method. Part of this library was screened using colony hybridization with [32P]cDNA prepared from induced and noninduced rat liver RNA. Colonies consistently giving a more intense signal with the induced [32P]cDNA were considered possible fibrinogen recombinants and were used for hybrid selection and translation of mRNA. In this way, cDNA clones for each of the three fibrinogen mRNA's were identified. Analysis of polyadenylated RNA by Northern blotting indicates that the three chains are synthesized from mRNA's of 2300, 2050, and 1950 nucleotides for the alpha, beta, and gamma chains, respectively. The fact tha each of the three chains has a separate mRNA indicates that the highly coordinated regulation of the three messages for rat fibrinogen does not occur by translation of a common cytoplasmic RNA.},

We have developed CEL-Seq, a method for overcoming this limitation by barcoding and pooling samples before linearly amplifying mRNA with the use of one round of in vitro transcription. We show that CEL-Seq gives more reproducible, linear, and sensitive results than a PCR-based amplification method. We demonstrate the power of this method by studying early C. elegans embryonic development at single-cell resolution. Differential distribution of transcripts between sister cells is seen as early as the two-cell stage embryo, and zygotic expression in the somatic cell lineages is enriched for transcription factors. The robust transcriptome quantifications enabled by CEL-Seq will be useful for transcriptomic analyses of complex tissues containing populations of diverse cell types.},

Hybridizations of two complex "total" cDNA probes (from the pre- and poststimulus states) to each member of a cDNA library are quantitatively analyzed and mathematically compared by using computer-assisted image processing and statistical analysis of sequential filter hybridizations. Experiments indicate that shifts in abundance between two states can be identified and reproducibly quantitated without purified probes. Direct isolation of recombinant cDNA colonies containing inserts corresponding to regulated RNAs is thus possible. The use of this system is demonstrated for partial analysis of the response in vivo of rat liver to glucocorticoids. Application to other biological systems in which a shift between two states occurs is discussed.},

However, tissues are invariably complex, and expression analysis of a tissue confounds the true expression patterns of its constituent cell types. Here we describe a novel strategy to access such complex samples. Single-cell RNA-seq expression profiles were generated, and clustered to form a two-dimensional cell map onto which expression data were projected. The resulting cell map integrates three levels of organization: the whole population of cells, the functionally distinct subpopulations it contains, and the single cells themselves-all without need for known markers to classify cell types. The feasibility of the strategy was demonstrated by analyzing the transcriptomes of 85 single cells of two distinct types. We believe this strategy will enable the unbiased discovery and analysis of naturally occurring cell types during development, adult physiology, and disease.},

Previous studies have shown a role for tight junction abnormalities in BBB leakage in multiple sclerosis (MS) brain. This marks a key stage in the development of inflammatory demyelination in MS. The aim of this study was to identify aberrantly expressed genes involved in BBB changes in MS lesions. A focused endothelial cell biology microarray, capable of detecting changes in expression of 113 endothelial cell-specific genes, was employed to analyse endothelial cell mRNA extracted from post-mortem control white matter, MS normal appearing white matter (NAWM), chronic active or inactive lesions by laser capture microdissection. Microarray analysis found 52 genes out of 113 analysed, predominantly in the activation functional group, to be differentially expressed in lesions compared to control or NAWM (p < 0.01). The majority of the differentially expressed genes were validated by quantitative real time PCR. In addition, the protein expression profiles of ICAM2, MMP2, and VEGFR1 were examined by immunofluorescent staining of selected tissue blocks. ICAM-2 was expressed at a higher level in chronic inactive lesions than control or NAWM, corresponding with the increased mRNA measured by microarray and real time PCR. The data shown, presenting a number of differentially expressed genes in the microvascular compartment of MS lesions, may shed light on the molecular mechanisms that are involved in the breakdown of the BBB. This moves us a step closer to the identification of potential therapeutic targets for repair of the compromised BBB.},

   abstract = {Considerable evidence indicates that mRNA associates with structural filaments in the cell (cytoskeleton). This relationship would be an important mechanism to effect mRNA sorting since specific mRNAs could be sequestered at sites within the cell. In addition, it can provide a mechanism for spatial regulation of mRNA expression. However, the precise structural interactions between mRNA and the cytoskeleton have yet to be defined. An objective of this work was to visualize "individual" poly(A) mRNA molecules in situ by electron microscopy to identify their relationship to individual filaments. Poly(A) RNA and filaments were identified simultaneously using antibodies to detect hybridized probe and filaments or actin-binding proteins. In human fibroblasts, most of the poly(A) mRNA (72%) was localized within 5 nm of orthogonal networks of F-actin filaments. Poly(A) mRNA also colocalized with vimentin filaments (29%) and microtubules (< 10%). The sites of mRNA localization were predominantly at filament intersections. The majority of poly(A) mRNA and polysomes colocalized with the actin crosslinking proteins, filamin, and alpha-actinin, and the elongation factor, EF-1 alpha (actin-binding protein; ABP-50). Evidence that intersections contained single mRNA molecules was provided by using a labeled oligo dT probe to prime the synthesis of cDNA in situ using reverse transcriptase. Both the poly(A) and cis sequences of the same mRNA molecule could then be visualized independently. We propose that the cytoskeletal intersection is a mRNA receptor and serves as a "microdomain" where mRNA is attached and functionally expressed.},

   abstract = {The heterogeneity of neural gene expression and the spatially limited expression of many low-abundance messenger RNAs in the brain has made cloning and analysis of such messages difficult. To generate amounts of nucleic acids sufficient for use in standard cloning strategies, we have devised a method for producing amplified heterogeneous populations of RNA from limited quantities of cDNA. Whole cerebellar RNA was primed with a synthetic oligonucleotide containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence 5&#039; to a polythymidylate region. After second-strand cDNA synthesis, T7 RNA polymerase was used to generate amplified antisense RNA (aRNA). Up to 80-fold molar amplification has been achieved from nanogram quantities of cDNA. The amplified material is similar in size distribution to the parent cDNA and shows sequence heterogeneity as assessed by Southern and Northern blot analysis. Specific messages for moderate-abundance mRNAs for actin and guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein) alpha subunits have been detected in the amplified material. By using in situ transcription to generate cDNA, sequences for cyclophilin have been detected in aRNA derived from single cerebellar tissue sections. cDNA derived from a single cerebellar Purkinje cell also has been amplified and yields material that hybridizes to cognate whole RNA and mRNA but not to Escherichia coli RNA.},

Here we introduce high-phylogenetic-resolution microbiome mapping by fluorescence in situ hybridization (HiPR-FISH), a versatile technology that uses binary encoding, spectral imaging and decoding based on machine learning to create micrometre-scale maps of the locations and identities of hundreds of microbial species in complex communities. We show that 10-bit HiPR-FISH can distinguish between 1,023 isolates of Escherichia coli, each fluorescently labelled with a unique binary barcode. HiPR-FISH, in conjunction with custom algorithms for automated probe design and analysis of single-cell images, reveals the disruption of spatial networks in the mouse gut microbiome in response to treatment with antibiotics, and the longitudinal stability of spatial architectures in the human oral plaque microbiome. Combined with super-resolution imaging, HiPR-FISH shows the diverse strategies of ribosome organization that are exhibited by taxa in the human oral microbiome. HiPR-FISH provides a framework for analysing the spatial ecology of environmental microbial communities at single-cell resolution.},

Here we present spatial profiling of a microbiome using sequential error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (SEER-FISH), a highly multiplexed and accurate imaging method that allows mapping of microbial communities at micron-scale. We show that multiplexity of RNA profiling in microbiomes can be increased significantly by sequential rounds of probe hybridization and dissociation. Combined with error-correction strategies, we demonstrate that SEER-FISH enables accurate taxonomic identification in complex microbial communities. Using microbial communities composed of diverse bacterial taxa isolated from plant rhizospheres, we show that SEER-FISH can quantify the abundance of each taxon and map microbial biogeography on roots. SEER-FISH should enable accurate spatial profiling of the ecology and function of complex microbial communities.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

The mechanism by which B cells are selected remains unclear, as does the role of the two anatomically defined areas of the GC, light zone (LZ) and dark zone (DZ). We combined a transgenic photoactivatable fluorescent protein tracer with multiphoton laser-scanning microscopy and flow cytometry to examine anatomically defined LZ and DZ B cells and GC selection. We find that B cell division is restricted to the DZ, with a net vector of B cell movement from the DZ to the LZ. The decision to return to the DZ and undergo clonal expansion is controlled by T helper cells in the GC LZ, which discern between LZ B cells based on the amount of antigen captured and presented. Thus, T cell help, and not direct competition for antigen, is the limiting factor in GC selection.},

Here, we determine transcriptomes of human SNc and VTA dopamine neurons using LCM-seq on a large sample cohort. We apply a bootstrapping strategy as sample input to DESeq2 and identify 33 stably differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between these two subpopulations. We also compute a minimal sample size for identification of stable DEGs, which highlights why previous reported profiles from small sample sizes display extensive variability. Network analysis reveal gene interactions unique to each subpopulation and highlight differences in regulation of mitochondrial stability, apoptosis, neuronal survival, cytoskeleton regulation, extracellular matrix modulation and well as synapse integrity, which could explain the relative resilience of VTA dopamine neurons. Analysis of PD tissues showed that while identified stable DEGs can distinguish the subpopulations also in disease, the SNc markers SLIT1 and ATP2A3 were downregulated and thus appears to be biomarkers of disease. In summary, our study identifies human SNc and VTA marker profiles, which will be instrumental for studies aiming to modulate dopamine neuron resilience and to validate cell identity of stem cell-derived dopamine neurons.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

   abstract = {Author summary In recent years single-cell RNA-sequencing technologies have emerged that allow scientists to measure the activity of genes in thousands of individual cells simultaneously. This means we can start to look at what each cell in a sample is doing instead of considering an average across all cells in a sample, as was the case with older technologies. However, while access to this kind of data presents a wealth of opportunities it comes with a new set of challenges. Researchers across the world have developed new methods and software tools to make the most of these datasets but the field is moving at such a rapid pace it is difficult to keep up with what is currently available. To make this easier we have developed the scRNA-tools database and website (www.scRNA-tools.org). Our database catalogues analysis tools, recording the tasks they can be used for, where they can be downloaded from and the publications that describe how they work. By looking at this database we can see that developers have focused on methods specific to single-cell data and that they embrace an open-source approach with permissive licensing, sharing of code and release of preprint publications.},

Here, we introduce Perler, a model-based method to integrate scRNA-seq data with reference in situ hybridization (ISH) data. To calibrate differences between these datasets, we develop a biologically interpretable model that uses generative linear mapping based on a Gaussian mixture model using the Expectation–Maximization algorithm. Perler accurately predicts the spatial gene expression of Drosophila embryos, zebrafish embryos, mammalian liver, and mouse visual cortex from scRNA-seq data. Furthermore, the reconstructed transcriptomes do not over-fit the ISH data and preserved the timing information of the scRNA-seq data. These results demonstrate the generalizability of Perler for dataset integration, thereby providing a biologically interpretable framework for accurate reconstruction of spatial transcriptomes in any multicellular system.},

   abstract = {Acquiring accurate single-cell multiomics profiles often requires performing unbiased in silico integration of data matrices generated by different single-cell technologies from the same biological sample. However, both the rows and the columns can represent different entities in different data matrices, making such integration a computational challenge that has only been solved approximately by existing approaches. Here, we present bindSC, a single-cell data integration tool that realizes simultaneous alignment of the rows and the columns between data matrices without making approximations. Using datasets produced by multiomics technologies as gold standard, we show that bindSC generates accurate multimodal co-embeddings that are substantially more accurate than those generated by existing approaches. Particularly, bindSC effectively integrated single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single cell chromatin accessibility sequencing (scATAC-seq) data towards discovering key regulatory elements in cancer cell-lines and mouse cells. It achieved accurate integration of both common and rare cell types (&amp;lt;0.25% abundance) in a novel mouse retina cell atlas generated using the 10x Genomics Multiome ATAC+RNA kit. Further, it achieves unbiased integration of scRNA-seq and 10x Visium spatial transcriptomics data derived from mouse brain cortex samples. Lastly, it demonstrated efficacy in delineating immune cell types via integrating single-cell RNA and protein data. Thus, bindSC, available at https://github.com/KChen-lab/bindSC, can be applied in a broad variety of context to accelerate discovery of complex cellular and biological identities and associated molecular underpinnings in diseases and developing organisms.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

These 3D models are complex and can contain cells at various stages of differentiation from different brain regions. Single-cell genomic methods provide powerful approaches to explore cell composition, differentiation trajectories, and genetic perturbations in brain organoid systems. However, it remains a major challenge to understand the heterogeneity observed within and between individual organoids. Here, we develop a set of computational tools (VoxHunt) to assess brain organoid patterning, developmental state, and cell identity through comparisons to spatial and single-cell transcriptome reference datasets. We use VoxHunt to characterize and visualize cell compositions using single-cell and bulk genomic data from multiple organoid protocols modeling different brain structures. VoxHunt will be useful to assess organoid engineering protocols and to annotate cell fates that emerge in organoids during genetic and environmental perturbation experiments.},

Both pandemics defied the capabilities of prevailing healthcare and public health. Since there was no known cure in either pandemic, much depended on nurses to fight the battle against the viruses. History has shown pandemics are occurring more frequently and are unpredictable in timing and severity. Therefore, we need to place focus on the valuable lessons from the century's two pandemics to prepare for future global disease outbreaks. Lessons that will benefit nursing are the importance of continual preparation and planning, care coordination across communities and healthcare systems, and ensuring nurses have the necessary resources and training to perform their roles in an effective and safe manner.},

A complete understanding of this process requires a systematic characterization of cell states over the entire spatiotemporal range of brain development. The ability of single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to reveal the molecular heterogeneity of complex tissues has therefore been particularly powerful in the nervous system. Previous studies have explored development in specific brain regions1–8, the whole adult brain9 and even entire embryos10. Here we report a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the embryonic mouse brain between gastrulation and birth. We identified almost eight hundred cellular states that describe a developmental program for the functional elements of the brain and its enclosing membranes, including the early neuroepithelium, region-specific secondary organizers, and both neurogenic and gliogenic progenitors. We also used in situ mRNA sequencing to map the spatial expression patterns of key developmental genes. Integrating the in situ data with our single-cell clusters revealed the precise spatial organization of neural progenitors during the patterning of the nervous system.},

MAIN BODY: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently occurring pandemic over world. It was emerged in Wuhan, China, in the end of December 2019 and spreading across worldwide. As the coronavirus is spreading easily through direct contact with infected people droplets, inhalation, and also air droplets, it hit up a huge amount of population even reported with death. Still, with small amounts of asymptomatic transmission between people it spreads throughout the globe. People need special care to protect from the transmission of disease. However, there are no drugs so far that shows efficacy; there is an immediate need for the development of vaccines. In order to decrease the COVID-19 cases, organizations rapidly involve in the preparation of vaccine and many vaccines have been developed by various countries. The governments took safety measures to control the spread of virus and also to minimize morbidity and mortality rate to least possible. CONCLUSION: The purpose of this review article is to increase our understanding of COVID-19 and facilitate the people to take a move in facing challenges of the world.},

We have applied multiple single-cell or -nucleus assays (&amp;gt;400,000 nuclei/cells) and spatial imaging technologies to a broad spectrum of healthy reference (n = 42) and disease (n = 42) kidneys. This has provided a high resolution cellular atlas of 100 cell types that include rare and novel cell populations. The multi-omic approach provides detailed transcriptomic profiles, epigenomic regulatory factors, and spatial localizations for major cell types spanning the entire kidney. We further identify and define cellular states altered in kidney injury, encompassing cycling, adaptive or maladaptive repair, transitioning and degenerative states affecting several segments. Molecular signatures of these states permitted their localization within injury neighborhoods using spatial transcriptomics, and large-scale 3D imaging analysis of ∼1.2 million neighborhoods provided linkages to active immune responses. These analyses further defined biological pathways relevant to injury niches, including signatures underlying the transition from reference to predicted maladaptive states that were associated with a decline in kidney function during chronic kidney disease. This human kidney cell atlas, including injury cell states and neighborhoods, will be a valuable resource for future studies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

However, our knowledge of their cellular composition and organization is limited. Here we present a single-cell and spatially resolved transcriptomics analysis of human breast cancers. We developed a single-cell method of intrinsic subtype classification (SCSubtype) to reveal recurrent neoplastic cell heterogeneity. Immunophenotyping using cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) provides high-resolution immune profiles, including new PD-L1/PD-L2+ macrophage populations associated with clinical outcome. Mesenchymal cells displayed diverse functions and cell-surface protein expression through differentiation within three major lineages. Stromal-immune niches were spatially organized in tumors, offering insights into antitumor immune regulation. Using single-cell signatures, we deconvoluted large breast cancer cohorts to stratify them into nine clusters, termed ‘ecotypes’, with unique cellular compositions and clinical outcomes. This study provides a comprehensive transcriptional atlas of the cellular architecture of breast cancer.},

Integrated computational analysis uncovered substantial remodelling in the lung epithelial, immune and stromal compartments, with evidence of multiple paths of failed tissue regeneration, including defective alveolar type 2 differentiation and expansion of fibroblasts and putative TP63+ intrapulmonary basal-like progenitor cells. Viral RNAs were enriched in mononuclear phagocytic and endothelial lung cells, which induced specific host programs. Spatial analysis in lung distinguished inflammatory host responses in lung regions with and without viral RNA. Analysis of the other tissue atlases showed transcriptional alterations in multiple cell types in heart tissue from donors with COVID-19, and mapped cell types and genes implicated with disease severity based on COVID-19 genome-wide association studies.

   abstract = {Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) metastatic tumors contribute to nearly 70% of breast cancer-related deaths. Most patients with ER+ metastatic breast cancer (MBC) undergo treatment with the estrogen receptor agonist fulvestrant (Fulv) as standard of care. Yet, among such patients, metastasis in liver is associated with reduced overall survival compared to other metastasis sites. The factors underlying the reduced responsiveness of liver metastases to ER agonists remain unknown, impeding the development of more effective treatment approaches to improve outcomes for patients with ER+ liver metastases. We therefore evaluated site-specific changes in MBC cells and determined the mechanisms through which the liver metastatic niche specifically influences ER+ tumor metabolism and drug resistance. We characterized ER activity of MBC cells both in vitro, using a novel system of tissue-specific extracellular matrix hydrogels representing the stroma of ER+ tumor metastatic sites (liver, lung and bone), and in vivo, in liver and lung metastasis mouse models. ER+ metastatic liver tumors and MBC cells grown in liver hydrogels displayed upregulated expression of glucose metabolism enzymes in response to Fulv. Furthermore, differential ERα activity, but not expression, was detected in liver hydrogels. In vivo, increased glucose metabolism led to increased glycogen deposition in liver metastatic tumors, while a fasting-mimicking diet increased efficacy of Fulv treatment to reduce the metastatic burden. Our findings identify a novel mechanism of endocrine resistance driven by the liver tumor microenvironment. These results may guide the development of dietary strategies to circumvent drug resistance in liver metastasis, with potential applicability in other metastatic diseases.Competing Interest StatementZME is funded by an investigator-initiated grant from Karyopharm Therapeutics.

This allows the complex cellular architecture and environment of diseased tissue to be explored. While spatial analysis techniques have revealed how cell-cell interactions are important within the disease pathology, there remains a gap in exploring changes in these interactions within the disease process. Specifically, there are currently no established methods for performing inference on cell localisation changes across images, hindering an understanding of how cellular environments change with a disease pathology.Results We have developed the spicyR R package to perform inference on changes in the spatial localisation of cell types across groups of images. Application to simulated data demonstrates a high sensitivity and specificity. We demonstrate the utility of spicyR by applying it to a type 1 diabetes imaging mass cytometry dataset, revealing changes in cellular associations that were relevant to the disease progression.

The prostate gland is hormonally regulated, requiring steroids for proliferation and differentiation of secretory luminal cells. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk of lethal prostate cancer, which exhibits a dedifferentiated pathology, linking vitamin D sufficiency to epithelial differentiation. To determine vitamin D regulation of prostatic epithelial differentiation, patient-derived benign prostate epithelial organoids were grown in vitamin D-deficient or -sufficient conditions. Organoids were assessed by phenotype and single-cell RNA sequencing. Mechanistic validation demonstrated that vitamin D sufficiency promoted organoid growth and accelerated differentiation by inhibiting canonical Wnt activity and suppressing Wnt family member DKK3. Wnt and DKK3 were also reduced by vitamin D in prostate tissue explants by spatial transcriptomics. Wnt dysregulation is a known contributor to aggressive prostate cancer, thus findings further link vitamin D deficiency to lethal disease.},

BOLORAMIS was demonstrated on a range of cell types and human cerebral organoids. Singleplex experiments to detect coding and non-coding RNAs in human iPSCs showed a stem-cell signature pattern. Specificity of BOLORAMIS was found to be 92% as illustrated by a clear distinction between human and mouse housekeeping genes in a co-culture system, as well as by recapitulation of subcellular localization of lncRNA MALAT1. Sensitivity of BOLORAMIS was quantified by comparing with single molecule FISH experiments and found to be 11%, 12% and 35% for GAPDH, TFRC and POLR2A, respectively. To demonstrate BOLORAMIS for multiplexed gene analysis, we targeted 96 mRNAs within a co-culture of iNGN neurons and HMC3 human microglial cells. We used fluorescence in situ sequencing to detect error-robust 8-base barcodes associated with each of these genes.

Moreover, by profiling the spatial expression of fifty key genes using In Situ Sequencing (ISS), we identify regions in the human ventral fetal forebrain where oligodendrogenesis first occurs.

   abstract = {The human brain is subdivided into distinct anatomical structures. The neocortex, one of these structures, enables higher-order sensory, associative, and cognitive functions, and in turn encompasses dozens of distinct specialized cortical areas. Early morphogenetic gradients are known to establish an early blueprint for the specification of brain regions and cortical areas. Furthermore, recent studies have uncovered distinct transcriptomic signatures between opposing poles of the developing neocortex1. However, how early, broad developmental patterns result in finer and more discrete spatial differences across the adult human brain remains poorly understood2. Here, we use single-cell RNA-sequencing to profile ten major brain structures and six neocortical areas during peak neurogenesis and early gliogenesis. Our data reveal that distinct cell subtypes are predominantly brain-structure specific. Within the neocortex, we find that even early in the second trimester, a large number of genes are differentially expressed across distinct cortical areas in all cell types, including radial glia, the neural progenitors of the cortex. However, the abundance of areal transcriptomic signatures increases as radial glia differentiate into intermediate progenitor cells and ultimately give rise to excitatory neurons. Using an automated, multiplexed single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) approach, we validated the expression pattern of area-specific neuronal genes and also discover that laminar gene expression patterns are highly dynamic across cortical regions. Together, our data suggest that early cortical areal patterning is defined by strong, mutually exclusive frontal and occipital gene expression signatures, with resulting gradients giving rise to the specification of areas between these two poles throughout successive developmental timepoints.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Despite recent advances in multiplexed amplification of FISH signals, it remains challenging to achieve high levels of simultaneous amplification and sequential detection with high sampling efficiency and simple workflows. Here we introduce signal amplification by exchange reaction (SABER), which endows oligonucleotide-based FISH probes with long, single-stranded DNA concatemers that aggregate a multitude of short complementary fluorescent imager strands. We show that SABER amplified RNA and DNA FISH signals (5- to 450-fold) in fixed cells and tissues. We also applied 17 orthogonal amplifiers against chromosomal targets simultaneously and detected mRNAs with high efficiency. We then used 10-plex SABER-FISH to identify in vivo introduced enhancers with cell-type-specific activity in the mouse retina. SABER represents a simple and versatile molecular toolkit for rapid and cost-effective multiplexed imaging of nucleic acid targets.},

   abstract = {Multiplexed mRNA profiling in the spatial context provides important new information enabling basic research and clinical applications. Unfortunately, most existing spatial transcriptomics methods are limited due to either low multiplexing or assay complexity. Here, we introduce a new spatialomics technology, termed Multi Omic Single-scan Assay with Integrated Combinatorial Analysis (MOSAICA), that integrates in situ labeling of mRNA and protein markers in cells or tissues with combinatorial fluorescence spectral and lifetime encoded probes, spectral and time-resolved fluorescence imaging, and machine learning-based target decoding. This technology is the first application combining the biophotonic techniques, Spectral and Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging and Microscopy (FLIM), to the field of spatial transcriptomics. By integrating the time dimension with conventional spectrum-based measurements, MOSAICA enables direct and highly-multiplexed in situ spatial biomarker profiling in a single round of staining and imaging while providing error correction removal of background autofluorescence. We demonstrate mRNA encoding using combinatorial spectral and lifetime labeling and target decoding and quantification using a phasor-based image segmentation and machine learning clustering technique. We then showcase MOSAICA’s multiplexing scalability in detecting 10-plex targets in fixed colorectal cancer cells using combinatorial labeling of only five fluorophores with facile error-correction and removal of autofluorescent moieties. MOSAICA’s analysis is strongly correlated with sequencing data (Pearson’s r = 0.9) and was further benchmarked using RNAscope™and LGC Stellaris™. We further apply MOSAICA for multiplexed analysis of clinical melanoma Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissues that have a high degree of tissue scattering and intrinsic autofluorescence, demonstrating the robustness of the approach. We then demonstrate simultaneous co-detection of protein and mRNA in colorectal cancer cells. MOSAICA represents a simple, versatile, and scalable tool for targeted spatial transcriptomics analysis that can find broad utility in constructing human cell atlases, elucidating biological and disease processes in the spatial context, and serving as companion diagnostics for stratified patient care.Competing Interest StatementT.V and J.G are shareholders of Arvetas Biosciences Inc.

This new bioinformatics scenario calls for effective and robust computational methods to identify genes with spatial patterns.We represent a novel Bayesian hierarchical model to analyze spatial transcriptomics data, with several unique characteristics. It models the zero-inflated and over-dispersed counts by deploying a zero-inflated negative binomial model that greatly increases model stability and robustness.

As a result, the proposed model shows competitive performances in accuracy and robustness over existing methods in both simulation studies and two real data applications.The related R/C++ source code is available at https://github.com/Minzhe/BOOST-GP.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. },

We applied MERINGUE to a variety of spatially resolved transcriptomic data sets including multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), spatial transcriptomics, Slide-seq, and aligned in situ hybridization (ISH) data.

We created 15 reference datasets to quantify MIST’s stitching accuracy. The datasets consist of three preparations of stem cell colonies seeded at low density and imaged with varying overlap (10 to 50%). The location and size of 1150 colonies are measured to quantify stitching accuracy. MIST generated stitched images with an average centroid distance error that is less than 2% of a FOV. The sources of these errors include mechanical uncertainties, specimen photobleaching, segmentation, and stitching inaccuracies. MIST produced higher stitching accuracy than three open-source tools.

Here, we benchmark 38 method and preprocessing combinations on 77 batches of gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and simulation data from 23 publications, altogether representing &amp;gt;1.2 million cells distributed in nine atlas-level integration tasks. Our integration tasks span several common sources of variation such as individuals, species, and experimental labs. We evaluate methods according to scalability, usability, and their ability to remove batch effects while retaining biological variation.Using 14 evaluation metrics, we find that highly variable gene selection improves the performance of data integration methods, whereas scaling pushes methods to prioritize batch removal over conservation of biological variation. Overall, BBKNN, Scanorama, and scVI perform well, particularly on complex integration tasks; Seurat v3 performs well on simpler tasks with distinct biological signals; and methods that prioritize batch removal perform best for ATAC-seq data integration.

Various methods have been developed for detecting SV (spatially variable) genes, with distinct spatial expression patterns. However, the accuracy of using such SV genes in clustering cell types has not been thoroughly studied. On the other hand, in single cell resolution sequencing data, clustering analysis is usually done on highly variable (HV) genes. Here we investigate if integrating SV genes and HV genes from spatial transcriptomics data can improve clustering performance beyond using SV genes alone. We evaluated six methods that integrate different features measured from the same samples including MOFA+, scVI, Seurat v4, CIMLR, SNF, and the straightforward concatenation approach. We applied these methods on 19 real datasets from three different spatial transcriptomics technologies (merFISH, SeqFISH+, and Visium) as well as 20 simulated datasets of varying spatial expression conditions. Our evaluations show that the performances of these integration methods are largely dependent on spatial transcriptomics platforms. Despite the variations among the results, in general MOFA+ and simple concatenation have good performances across different types of spatial transcriptomics platforms. This work shows that integrating quantitative and spatial marker genes in the spatial transcriptomics data can improve clustering. It also provides practical guides on the choices of computational methods to accomplish this goal.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Given inputs as gene expression or RNA velocity, RESEPT learns a three-dimensional embedding with a spatial retained graph neural network from the spatial transcriptomics. The embedding is then visualized by mapping as color channels in an RGB image and segmented with a supervised convolutional neural network model. Based on a benchmark of sixteen 10x Genomics Visium spatial transcriptomics datasets on the human cortex, RESEPT infers and visualizes the tissue architecture accurately. It is noteworthy that, for the in-house AD samples, RESEPT can localize cortex layers and cell types based on a pre-defined region-or cell-type-specific genes and furthermore provide critical insights into the identification of amyloid-beta plaques in Alzheimer’s disease.

   abstract = {Spatial transcriptomics has been emerging as a powerful technique for resolving gene expression profiles while retaining tissue spatial information. These spatially resolved transcriptomics make it feasible to examine the complex multicellular systems of different microenvironments. To answer scientific questions with spatial transcriptomics and expand our understanding of how cell types and states are regulated by microenvironment, the first step is to identify cell clusters by integrating the available spatial information. Here, we introduce SC-MEB, an empirical Bayes approach for spatial clustering analysis using a hidden Markov random field. We have also derived an efficient expectation-maximization algorithm based on an iterative conditional mode for SC-MEB. In contrast to BayesSpace, a recently developed method, SC-MEB is not only computationally efficient and scalable to large sample sizes but is also capable of choosing the smoothness parameter and the number of clusters. We performed comprehensive simulation studies to demonstrate the superiority of SC-MEB over some existing methods. We applied SC-MEB to analyze the spatial transcriptome of human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissues and mouse hypothalamic preoptic region. Our analysis results showed that SC-MEB can achieve a similar or better clustering performance to BayesSpace, which uses the true number of clusters and a fixed smoothness parameter. Moreover, SC-MEB is scalable to large ‘sample sizes’. We then employed SC-MEB to analyze a colon dataset from a patient with colorectal cancer (CRC) and COVID-19, and further performed differential expression analysis to identify signature genes related to the clustering results. The heatmap of identified signature genes showed that the clusters identified using SC-MEB were more separable than those obtained with BayesSpace. Using pathway analysis, we identified three immune-related clusters, and in a further comparison, found the mean expression of COVID-19 signature genes was greater in immune than non-immune regions of colon tissue. SC-MEB provides a valuable computational tool for investigating the structural organizations of tissues from spatial transcriptomic data.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

   abstract = {Recent advances in spatially resolved transcriptomics have enabled comprehensive measurements of gene expression patterns while retaining spatial context of tissue microenvironment. Deciphering the spatial context of spots in a tissue needs to use their spatial information carefully. To this end, we developed a graph attention auto-encoder framework STGATE to accurately identify spatial domains by learning low-dimensional latent embeddings via integrating spatial information and gene expression profiles. To better characterize the spatial similarity at the boundary of spatial domains, STGATE adopts an attention mechanism to adaptively learn the similarity of neighboring spots, and an optional cell type-aware module through integrating the pre-clustering of gene expressions. We validated STGATE on diverse spatial transcriptomics datasets generated by different platforms with different spatial resolutions. STGATE could substantially improve the identification accuracy of spatial domains, and denoise the data while preserving spatial expression patterns. Importantly, STGATE could be extended to multiple consecutive sections for reducing batch effects between sections and extracting 3D expression domains from the reconstructed 3D tissue effectively.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Significant debate exists as to this tissue’s cellular composition and genes associated with their functions. We use a repertoire of cell profiling tools to comprehensively define and spatial resolve cell types. We characterize spatially validated, basal-to-luminal gene expression dynamics within the urothelium, the cellular source of most bladder cancers. We define three distinct populations of fibroblasts that spatially organize from the sub-urothelial layer through to the detrusor muscle, clarifying knowledge around these controversial interstitial cells, and associate increased fibroblasts with aging. We overcome challenges of profiling the detrusor muscle, absence from earlier single cell studies, to report on its transcriptome with many novel and neuronal-like features presumably associated with neuromuscular junctions. Our approach provides a blueprint for tissue atlas construction and the data provides the foundation for future studies of bladder function in health and disease.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Here we investigate the spatial organization and transcriptional profile of individual cells in both wild type (WT) and Tet2−/− fetal livers, by multiplexed error robust fluorescence in situ hybridization. We find that specific pairs of fetal liver cell types are preferentially positioned next to each other. Ligand-receptor signaling molecule pairs such as Kitl and Kit are enriched in neighboring cell types. The majority of HSCs are in direct contact with endothelial cells (ECs) in both WT and Tet2−/− fetal livers. Loss of Tet2 increases the number of HSCs, and upregulates Wnt and Notch signaling genes in the HSC niche. Two subtypes of ECs, arterial ECs and sinusoidal ECs, and other cell types contribute distinct signaling molecules to the HSC niche.

   abstract = {The function of mammalian cells is largely influenced by their tissue microenvironment. Advances in spatial transcriptomics open the way for studying these important determinants of cellular function by enabling a transcriptome-wide evaluation of gene expression in situ. A critical limitation of the current technologies, however, is that their resolution is limited to niches (spots) of sizes well beyond that of a single cell, thus providing measurements for cell aggregates which may mask critical interactions between neighboring cells of different types. While joint analysis with single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be leveraged to alleviate this problem, current analyses are limited to a discrete view of cell type proportion inside every spot. This limitation becomes critical in the common case where, even within a cell type, there is a continuum of cell states that cannot be clearly demarcated but reflects important differences in the way cells function and interact with their surroundings. To address this, we developed Deconvolution of Spatial Transcriptomics profiles using Variational Inference (DestVI), a probabilistic method for multi-resolution analysis for spatial transcriptomics that explicitly models continuous variation within cell types. Using simulations, we demonstrate that DestVI is capable of providing higher resolution compared to the existing methods and that it can estimate gene expression by every cell type inside every spot. We then introduce an automated pipeline that uses DestVI for analysis of single tissue slices and comparison between tissues. We apply this pipeline to study the immune crosstalk within lymph nodes to infection and explore the spatial organization of a mouse tumor model. In both cases, we demonstrate that DestVI can provide a high resolution and accurate spatial characterization of the cellular organization of these tissues, and that it is capable of identifying important cell-type-specific changes in gene expression - between different tissue regions or between conditions. DestVI is available as an open-source software package in the scvi-tools codebase (https://scvi-tools.org).Competing Interest StatementN.Y. is an advisor and/or has equity in Cellarity, Celsius Therapeutics, and Rheos Medicine.},

Third, in situ single-cell transcriptomics provides a spatially resolved cell-type atlas of the motor cortex. Fourth, cross-modal analysis provides compelling evidence for the transcriptomic, epigenomic and gene regulatory basis of neuronal phenotypes such as their physiological and anatomical properties, demonstrating the biological validity and genomic underpinning of neuron types. We further present an extensive genetic toolset for targeting glutamatergic neuron types towards linking their molecular and developmental identity to their circuit function. Together, our results establish a unifying and mechanistic framework of neuronal cell-type organization that integrates multi-layered molecular genetic and spatial information with multi-faceted phenotypic properties. The BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network has constructed a multimodal cell census and atlas of the mammalian primary motor&nbsp;cortex in a landmark effort towards understanding brain cell-type diversity,&nbsp;neural circuit organization and brain function.},

   abstract = {While post-transcriptional control is thought to be required at the periphery of neurons and glia, its extent is unclear. Here, we investigate systematically the spatial distribution and expression of mRNA at single molecule sensitivity and their corresponding proteins of 200 YFP trap protein trap lines across the intact Drosophila nervous system. 98% of the genes studied showed discordance between the distribution of mRNA and the proteins they encode in at least one region of the nervous system. These data suggest that post-transcriptional regulation is very common, helping to explain the complexity of the nervous system. We also discovered that 68.5% of these genes have transcripts present at the periphery of neurons, with 9.5% at the glial periphery. Peripheral transcripts include many potential new regulators of neurons, glia and their interactions. Our approach is applicable to most genes and tissues and includes powerful novel data annotation and visualisation tools for post-transcriptional regulation.

Brief outline A novel high resolution and sensitive approach to systematically co-visualise the distribution of mRNAs and proteins in the intact nervous system reveals that post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is very common. The rich data landscape is provided as a browsable resource ([link][1]), using Zegami, a cloud-based data exploration platform ([link][2]). Our solution provides a paradigm for the characterisation of post-transcriptional regulation of most genes and model systems.

Current hybridization-based methods cannot differentiate small regulatory variants, while in situ sequencing is limited by short reads. We solved these problems using a bidirectional sequencing chemistry to efficiently image transcript-specific barcode in situ , which are then extracted and assembled into longer reads using NGS. In the Drosophila retina, genes regulating eye development and cytoskeletal organization were enriched compared to methods using extracted RNA. We therefore named our method In Situ Transcriptome Accessibility sequencing (INSTA-seq). Sequencing reads terminated near 3’ UTR cis -motifs (e.g. Zip48C, stau ), revealing RNA-protein interactions. Additionally, Act5C polyadenylation isoforms retaining zipcode motifs were selectively localized to the optical stalk, consistent with their biology. Our platform provides a powerful way to visualize any RNA variants or protein interactions in situ to study their regulation in animal development.},

Spatial gene expression patterns are critical for the understanding of complex pathways and interactions, whereas temporal gene expression changes are vital for studying highly dynamic physiological activities. Systematic studies in Drosophila are still impeded by the lack of spatiotemporal transcriptomic information. Here, utilizing spatial enhanced resolution omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq), we dissected the spatiotemporal transcriptomic changes of developing Drosophila with high resolution and sensitivity. We demonstrated that Stereo-seq data can be used for the 3D reconstruction of the spatial transcriptomes of Drosophila embryos and larvae. With these 3D models, we identified functional subregions in embryonic and larval midguts, uncovered spatial cell state dynamics of larval testis, and revealed known and potential regulons of transcription factors within their topographic background. Our data provide the Drosophila research community with useful resources of organism-wide spatiotemporally resolved transcriptomic information across developmental stages.},

The approach relies on (1) multiplexed readout of proteins or RNAs using oligonucleotide tags; (2) oligonucleotide tags attached to affinity reagents (antibodies or RNA probes) through a photocleavable (PC) linker; and (3) photocleaving light projected onto the tissue sample to release PC oligonucleotides in any spatial pattern across a region of interest (ROI) covering 1 to ~5,000 cells. DSP is capable of single-cell sensitivity within an ROI using the antibody readout, with RNA detection feasible down to ~600 individual mRNA transcripts. We show spatial profiling of up to 44 proteins and 96 genes (928 RNA probes) in lymphoid, colorectal tumor and autoimmune tissues by using the nCounter system and 1,412 genes (4,998 RNA probes) by using next-generation sequencing (NGS). DSP may be used to profile not only proteins and RNAs in biobanked samples but also immune markers in patient samples, with potential prognostic and predictive potential for clinical decision-making. A turnkey system allows for spatial profiling of proteins and RNA in fixed tissues, providing a window on cellular heterogeneity.},

We performed spatial transcriptomic profiling of over 100,000 cells from the mouse retina, uncovering the spatial distribution of all major retina cell types with over 100 cell subtypes. Our data revealed that the retina is organized in a laminar structure at the major cell type and subgroup level, both of which has strong correlation with the birth order of the cell. In contrast, overall random dispersion of cells within sub-laminar layers indicates that retinal mosaics are driven by dendritic field patterning rather than neuron soma placement. Through the integration of single cell transcriptomic and spatial data, we have generated the first comprehensive spatial single cell reference atlas of the mouse retina, a resource to the community and an essential step toward gaining a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of retinal function.

By integrating these multi-omic datasets, we provide validated strategies to reliably discriminate and localize all hepatic cells, including a population of lipid-associated macrophages (LAMs) at the bile ducts. We then align this atlas across seven species, revealing the conserved program of bona fide Kupffer cells and LAMs. We also uncover the respective spatially resolved cellular niches of these macrophages and the microenvironmental circuits driving their unique transcriptomic identities. We demonstrate that LAMs are induced by local lipid exposure, leading to their induction in steatotic regions of the murine and human liver, while Kupffer cell development crucially depends on their cross-talk with hepatic stellate cells via the evolutionarily conserved ALK1-BMP9/10 axis.},

Cellpose was trained on a new dataset of highly varied images of cells, containing over 70,000 segmented objects. We also demonstrate a three-dimensional (3D) extension of Cellpose that reuses the two-dimensional (2D) model and does not require 3D-labeled data. To support community contributions to the training data, we developed software for manual labeling and for curation of the automated results. Periodically retraining the model on the community-contributed data will ensure that Cellpose improves constantly. Cellpose is a generalist, deep learning-based approach for segmenting structures in a wide range of image types. Cellpose does not require parameter adjustment or model retraining and outperforms established methods on 2D and 3D datasets.},

   abstract = {The identification of genes that vary across spatial domains in tissues and cells is an essential step for spatial transcriptomics data analysis. Given the critical role it serves for downstream data interpretations, various methods for detecting spatially variable genes (SVGs) have been proposed. The availability of multiple methods for detecting SVGs bears questions such as whether different methods select a similar set of SVGs, how reliable is the reported statistics significance from each method, how accurate and robust is each method in terms of SVG detection, and how well the selected SVGs perform in downstream applications such as clustering of spatial domains. Besides these, practical considerations such as computational time and memory usage are also crucial for deciding which method to use. In this study, we address the above questions by systematically evaluating a panel of popular SVG detection methods on a large collection of spatial transcriptomics datasets, covering various tissue types, biotechnologies, and spatial resolutions. Our results shed light on the performance of each method from multiple aspects and highlight the discrepancy among different methods especially on calling statistically significant SVGs across datasets. Taken together, our work provides useful considerations for choosing methods for identifying SVGs and serves as a key reference for the future development of such methods.

   abstract = {Background: Cell-cell interactions are important for information exchange between different cells, which are the fundamental basis of many biological processes. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enable the characterization of cell-cell interactions using computational methods. However, it is hard to evaluate these methods since no ground truth is provided. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) data profiles the relative position of different cells. We propose that the spatial distance suggests the interaction tendency of different cell types, thus could be used for evaluating cell-cell interaction tools. Results: We benchmark 16 cell-cell interaction methods by integrating scRNA-seq with ST data. We characterize cell-cell interactions into short-range and long-range interactions using spatial distance distributions between ligands and receptors. Based on this classification, we define the distance enrichment score and apply an evaluation workflow to 16 cell-cell interaction tools using 15 simulated and 5 real scRNA-seq and ST datasets. We also compare the consistency of the results from single tools with the commonly identified interactions. Our results suggest that the interactions predicted by different tools are highly dynamic, and the statistical-based methods show overall better performance than network-based methods and ST-based methods. Conclusions: Our study presents a comprehensive evaluation of cell-cell interaction tools for scRNA-seq. CellChat, CellPhoneDB, NicheNet, and ICELLNET show overall better performance than other tools in terms of consistency with spatial tendency and software scalability. We recommend using results from at least two methods to ensure the accuracy of identified interactions. We have packaged the benchmark workflow with detailed documentation at GitHub (https://github.com/wanglabtongji/CCI).},

   abstract = {Spatial transcriptomics technologies are used to profile transcriptomes while preserving spatial information, which enables high-resolution characterization of transcriptional patterns and reconstruction of tissue architecture. Due to the existence of low-resolution spots in recent spatial transcriptomics technologies, uncovering cellular heterogeneity is crucial for disentangling the spatial patterns of cell types, and many related methods have been proposed. Here, we benchmark 18 existing methods resolving a cellular deconvolution task with 50 real-world and simulated datasets by evaluating the accuracy, robustness, and usability of the methods. We compare these methods comprehensively using different metrics, resolutions, spatial transcriptomics technologies, spot numbers, and gene numbers. In terms of performance, CARD, Cell2location, and Tangram are the best methods for conducting the cellular deconvolution task. To refine our comparative results, we provide decision-tree-style guidelines and recommendations for method selection and their additional features, which will help users easily choose the best method for fulfilling their concerns. This study comprehensively benchmarks 18 state-of-the-art methods for cellular deconvolution of spatial transcriptomics and provide decision-tree-style guidelines and recommendations for method selection.},

   abstract = {MOTIVATION: The rapid development of spatial transcriptomics (ST) approaches has provided new insights into understanding tissue architecture and function. However, the gene expressions measured at a spot may contain contributions from multiple cells due to the low-resolution of current ST technologies. Although many computational methods have been developed to disentangle discrete cell types from spatial mixtures, the community lacks a thorough evaluation of the performance of those deconvolution methods. RESULTS: Here, we present a comprehensive benchmarking of 14 deconvolution methods on four datasets. Furthermore, we investigate the robustness of different methods to sequencing depth, spot size and the choice of normalization. Moreover, we propose a new ensemble learning-based deconvolution method (EnDecon) by integrating multiple individual methods for more accurate deconvolution. The major new findings include: (i) cell2loction, RCTD and spatialDWLS are more accurate than other ST deconvolution methods, based on the evaluation of three metrics: RMSE, PCC and JSD; (ii) cell2location and spatialDWLS are more robust to the variation of sequencing depth than RCTD; (iii) the accuracy of the existing methods tends to decrease as the spot size becomes smaller; (iv) most deconvolution methods perform best when they normalize ST data using the method described in their original papers; and (v) the integrative method, EnDecon, could achieve more accurate ST deconvolution. Our study provides valuable information and guideline for practically applying ST deconvolution tools and developing new and more effective methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The benchmarking pipeline is available at https://github.com/SunXQlab/ST-deconvoulution. An R package for EnDecon is available at https://github.com/SunXQlab/EnDecon. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

   abstract = {Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies allow researchers to examine transcriptional profiles along with maintained positional information. Such spatially resolved transcriptional characterization of intact tissue samples provides an integrated view of gene expression in its natural spatial and functional context. However, high-Throughput -based ST technologies cannot yet reach single cell resolution. Thus, similar to bulk RNA-seq data, gene expression data at ST spot-level reflect transcriptional profiles of multiple cells and entail the inference of cell-Type composition within each ST spot for valid and powerful subsequent analyses. Realizing the critical importance of cell-Type decomposition, multiple groups have developed ST deconvolution methods. The aim of this work is to review state-of-The-Art methods for ST deconvolution, comparing their strengths and weaknesses. In particular, we construct ST spots from single-cell level ST data to assess the performance of 10 methods, with either ideal reference or non-ideal reference. Furthermore, we examine the performance of these methods on spot-and bead-level ST data by comparing estimated cell-Type proportions to carefully matched single-cell ST data. In comparing the performance on various tissues and technological platforms, we concluded that RCTD and stereoscope achieve more robust and accurate inferences.},

   abstract = {The increasing popularity of spatial transcriptomics has allowed researchers to analyze transcriptome data in its tissue sample’s spatial context. Various methods have been developed for detecting SV (spatially variable) genes, with distinct spatial expression patterns. However, the accuracy of using these SV genes in clustering has not been thoroughly studied. On the other hand, in single cell resolution sequencing data without spatial context, clustering analysis is usually done on highly variable (HV) genes. Here we investigate if integrating SV genes and HV genes from spatial transcriptomics data can improve clustering performance beyond using SV genes alone. We examined three methods that detect SV genes, including Giotto, spatialDE, and SPARK, and evaluated six methods that integrate different features measured from the same samples including MOFA+, scVI, Seurat v4, CIMLR, SNF, and the straightforward concatenation approach. We applied these methods on 19 real datasets from three different spatial transcriptomics technologies (merFISH, SeqFISH+, and Visium) as well as 20 simulated datasets of varying spatial expression conditions. Our evaluations show that MOFA+ and simple concatenation have good performances in general, despite the variations among datasets and spatial transcriptomics platforms. This work shows that integrating highly variable and spatially variable genes in the spatial transcriptomics data can improve clustering beyond using spatially variable genes only. It also provides practical guides on the choices of computational methods to accomplish this goal.

   abstract = {Spatial transcriptomics approaches have substantially advanced our capacity to detect the spatial distribution of RNA transcripts in tissues, yet it remains challenging to characterize whole-transcriptome-level data for single cells in space. Addressing this need, researchers have developed integration methods to combine spatial transcriptomic data with single-cell RNA-seq data to predict the spatial distribution of undetected transcripts and/or perform cell type deconvolution of spots in histological sections. However, to date, no independent studies have comparatively analyzed these integration methods to benchmark their performance. Here we present benchmarking of 16 integration methods using 45 paired datasets (comprising both spatial transcriptomics and scRNA-seq data) and 32 simulated datasets. We found that Tangram, gimVI, and SpaGE outperformed other integration methods for predicting the spatial distribution of RNA transcripts, whereas Cell2location, SpatialDWLS, and RCTD are the top-performing methods for the cell type deconvolution of spots. We provide a benchmark pipeline to help researchers select optimal integration methods to process their datasets. This work presents a comprehensive benchmarking analysis of computational methods that integrates spatial and single-cell transcriptomics data for transcript distribution prediction and cell type deconvolution.},
