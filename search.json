CISI optimized reducing number imaging cycles avoiding direct spot calling demonstrated large number genes (Cleary et al. 2021). distinctive feature MOSAICA use color lifetime fluorophores demonstrated 10-plex (Vu et al. 2021). Recent applications existing techniques also tend feature larger number cells 100 something genes (e.g. 120 genes (Langseth et al. 2021)), smFISH based dataset complementary scRNA-seq datasets system, using marker genes scRNA-seq clusters.MERFISH smFISH based technique used institutions (Figure 4.7), although smFISH based techniques barely spread beyond institutions origin, (Figure 5.24). following advantages disadvantages smFISH based techniques may explain trends usage. Advantages disadvantages individual smFISH based techniques reviewed far summarized Table 5.1.\nFigure 5.23: Number publications time, broken technique type.

Nevertheless, shows interest MERFISH seqFISH beyond institutions origin.\nFigure 5.25: Geographical locations institutions used certain techniques. Point area proportional number publication city interest. Gray points background publications using smFISH based techniques. cities institutions labeled first author. Note seqFISH, hidden Markov random field (HMRF) study Dana Faber (Zhu et al. 2018) mouse embryo study (Lohoff et al. 2020) collaboration Long Cai’s group Caltech, dataset likely still collected Caltech.\nSmFISH based techniques following advantages. First, smFISH, especially larger number probes, nearly 100% detection efficiency transcripts (Lubeck Cai 2012), .e. detecting almost transcripts present. Different ways evaluate efficiency spatial transcriptomics techniques reported. reported “efficiency” MERFISH estimated average ratio number transcripts per segmented cell detected MERFISH detected smFISH cell type 10 genes. combinatorial barcoding, however, efficiency decreased. Studies techniques may use different ways estimate efficiency. Compared smFISH, MERFISH version 2 HD4 code 95% detection efficiency 130 genes 92 probes per gene, although efficiency dropped ~25% HD2 code can encode nearly 1000 genes can identify correct errors (Moffitt et al. 2016; Foreman Wollman 2019). scaled 10,050 genes, MERFISH around 79% detection efficiency (C. Xia, Babcock, et al. 2019). HCR-seqFISH, efficiency around 84% (smFISH HCR-seqFISH performed cell 5 genes) (Shah et al. 2016), seqFISH+, around 49% (slope line fitted average transcript count per cell seqFISH+ vs. smFISH 60 genes) (Eng et al. 2019). Nevertheless, much better efficiency ST, around 6.9% compared smFISH 2016 ST study (transcript counts 3 genes ST spots compared smFISH 100 \\(\\mu\\)m diameter discs comparable brain regions adjacent section) (Ståhl et al. 2016). put 6.9% context, ERCC spike ins cases comparison smFISH, scRNA-seq methods Drop-seq, 10X, inDrop, CEL-seq, CEL-seq2 capture efficiency 3% 25% (Macosko et al. 2015; Zheng et al. 2017; Klein et al. 2015; Hashimshony et al. 2016; Grün, Kester, Oudenaarden 2014). Thus smFISH based spatial transcriptomics methods can much efficient scRNA-seq, though efficiency RCA based smFISH compared regular smFISH reported.Second, since individual transcripts imaged counted, smFISH based methods highly quantitative records subcellular localization transcripts. smFISH based spatial transcriptomics studies analyze data cellular gene count level, using subcellular transcript localization, cells shown show great variation subcellular localization transcripts set genes number “archetypal” patterns described (Samacoits et al. 2018; Stoeger et al. 2015; Cabili et al. 2015).following disadvantages may explain smFISH based spatial transcriptomics widely used large number cells genes (Figure 5.21, Figure 5.22), MERFISH used technique (Figure 5.23). First, multiple rounds hybridization high magnification mean data collection time consuming. MERFISH version 2 greatly sped imaging, version 1 requires higher magnification needs photobleach fields view (FOV) one time; one FOV version 1 40 \\(\\mu\\)m \\(\\times\\) 40 \\(\\mu\\)m, one FOV version 2 223 \\(\\mu\\)m \\(\\times\\) 223 \\(\\mu\\)m. Version 2 also cut imaging time half using 2 colors, targeting 2 bits per round. way, 130 genes 40,000 cells, MERFISH took 18 hours (Moffitt et al. 2016), HCR-seqFISH take days overnight hybridization probes stripped round hybridization although seqFISH barcode much shorter. scaled 10,000 genes, MERFISH takes 23 rounds hybridization (C. Xia, Fan, et al. 2019), seqFISH+ takes 80 rounds (Eng et al. 2019), although ExM used MERFISH case reduce optical crowding, expanding area images ~4 folds, actual imaging time ExM-MERFISH seqFISH+ may comparable. Perhaps MERFISH scaled larger number cells used studies beyond institution origin (Figure 5.25) higher detection efficiency shorter imaging time.\nFigure 5.26: Number publications using smFISH based techniques used 5 common programming languages. icon stands 2 publications.\nSecond, increasing area tissue number genes covered, smFISH based spatial transcriptomics generates terabytes images – FOV, image channel, z-plane, round hybridization. Images MERFISH dataset 40,000 cells 130 genes took 2 3 days process multi-core server, although number cores stated (Moffitt et al. 2016). contrast, takes hours, even just minutes, process fastq files scRNA-seq dataset get gene count matrix (Melsted et al. 2021), fastq files take much disk space. user, processing upstream form data much challenging highly multiplexed smFISH scRNA-seq. 2019, software process images decode combinatorial barcodes typically written proprietary programming language MATLAB (Figure 5.26), poorly documented, difficult people outside lab origin use.recently, Python replacing MATLAB programming language choice write image processing software. Chan Zuckerberg Initiative developed starfish Python unified framework process smFISH based spatial transcriptomics data (Axelrod et al., n.d.). However, image processing pipelines specific technology developed instead, MERlin MERFISH (C. Xia, Fan, et al. 2019) IRIS ISS (Zhou et al. 2020), image stitching performed separately MIST (Chalfoun et al. 2017) BigStitcher (Hörl et al. 2019) needed starfish directly support multiple FOVs. starfish used HybISS group (Bruggen et al. 2021; Gyllborg et al. 2020) spot calling, decoding, cell segmentation, CISI group spot calling (Cleary et al. 2021) CellProfiler cell segmentation. relatively highly multiplexed smFISH studies present, ’s hard say whether starfish way widespread use. contrast, scRNA-seq, popular data processing tools apply across technologies, STAR (wrapped Cell Ranger) (Dobin et al. 2012), alevin (Srivastava et al. 2019), kallisto (Melsted et al. 2021). Furthermore, even open source interoperable image processing pipeline, cell segmentation, essential obtaining gene count matrix commonly used data analysis, challenging.Third, custom fluidics systems used numerous rounds hybridization (Eng et al. 2019; Moffitt et al. 2016; Codeluppi et al. 2018). custom fluidics pump systems commercially available need built lab wishes adopt smFISH based technologies. best knowledge, core facilities perform smFISH based spatial transcriptomics. Thus user, adopting smFISH based spatial transcriptomics technique means learning new syntax process images, made difficult cases cost MATLAB lack documentation, also setting complex custom fluidics system integrated microscope, may feasible microscopy cores. However, might change soon MERSCOPE, Rebus Esper spatial omics platform, Molecular Cartography Resolve Biosciences (yet formally released early access program), 10X’s upcoming situ platform (might ISS based ’s based CARTANA ReadCoor (commercialization FISSEQ)). Rebus Esper used automate osmFISH (Bhaduri et al. 2021), claims less one hour hands time able return gene count matrix 100,000 cells spatial coordinates cells within 2 days. Molecular Cartography smFISH based, ’s clear website works. Aria Fluigent can also potentially used automate highly multiplexed FISH. commercial options relatively affordable adopted core facilities, expect highly multiplexed smFISH techniques become widely used.Fourth, profile large numbers genes, numerous probes need designed, especially dozens probes used gene enhance signal. Probes fluorophores expensive well larger quantity needed signal amplification. probes expensive one time purchase, might worthwhile lab perform highly multiplexed smFISH often. core facility good collection probes can reduce cost individual labs, reiterate, writing, unaware core facility performing highly multiplexed smFISH techniques MERFISH (except NeuroTechnology Studio Brigham Health MERFISH) seqFISH. Cost probes reason recent applications highly multiplexed smFISH techniques profile larger number genes. Finally, smFISH based techniques require pre-defined list genes probes, unlike RNA-seq, novel transcripts missed.\nTable 5.1: Pros cons smFISH based techniques.\nfar reviewed studies showcase new techniques technical improvements signal amplification resolving optical crowding. smFISH based techniques used studies focus biological problems rather new techniques. HCR-seqFISH used twice biological studies, chicken neural tube (35 genes) (Lignell et al. 2017) mouse T cell precursors (65 genes) (Zhou et al. 2019) though conducted within Caltech, institution origin. Moreover, spatial location cells necessarily reason use HCR-seqFISH; Zhou et al. used HCR-seqFISH high detection efficiency compared scRNA-seq dissociated FACS sorted T cell progenitors, spatial information already lost. recently, pseudocolor seqFISH used mouse embryo atlas University Cambridge (though Long Cai still coauthor), finally moving beyond stage testing new biological research (Lohoff et al. 2020). Combinatorial barcoding also used profile bacterial species microbiome targeting rRNAs, though profile transcriptome, single molecular (Shi et al. 2020; Cao et al. 2021). spatial transcriptome bacteria, new version seqFISH, par-seqFISH, developed profile 105 genes biofilm bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Dar et al. 2021). may open way spatial transcriptomics biofilms, microbiome general.MERFISH used broadly biological studies. Within Harvard, institution origin, MERFISH used create atlases hypothalamic preoptic region (155 genes) (Moffitt et al. 2018) primary motor cortex (MOp) (258 genes) (Zhang et al. 2020) mice, adapted stain chromatin conformation transcription foci (introns) (Su Song 2020). Outside Harvard (Figure 5.25), MERFISH used study gene expression variability relates cell state cell culture (Foreman Wollman 2019) used conjunction smFISH based chromatin tracing study relationships chromatin compartmentalization gene expression (M. Liu et al. 2020).inception, HybISS became part single cell atlas developing mouse nervous system (La Manno et al. 2021). atlas mostly scRNA-seq data, 119 genes stained HybISS validate secondary organizers discovered via scRNA-seq. part HCA, HybISS also used human adult temporal lobe (Langseth et al. 2021) fetal forebrain (Bruggen et al. 2021).","code":"## \n## Call:\n## lm(formula = log(n_genes) ~ date_published, data = smfish)\n## \n## Residuals:\n##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n## -3.9210 -1.0906  0.1353  0.4179  4.7264 \n## \n## Coefficients:\n##                 Estimate Std.

First, SOLiD fallen favor limited read length used situ (5-30 nt), propagation errors previous cycles (Alon et al. 2020), difficulty sequencing panlindromic sequences (Giani et al. 2020). SOLiD chosen FISSEQ works well room temperature; though SBS supports longer read lengths, requires heated stage (Lee et al. 2015). Second, FISSEQ extremely inefficient, 20 times less sensitive scRNA-seq two orders magnitude less sensitive 2013 Nilsson ISS (discussed later section) (Lee et al. 2015), part inefficiency random RT priming (Lee et al. 2014) tight packing amplicons (Alon et al. 2020). Furthermore, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) depleted, ~40-80% FISSEQ reads rRNA (Lee et al. 2014, 2015). 200 mRNA reads detected per cell FISSEQ without rRNA depletion, compared 40,000 scRNA-seq, suppose detection efficiency scRNA-seq 10%, detection efficiency FISSEQ might around 0.005% (Lee et al. 2015). Third, highly abundant genes involved translation splicing depleted FISSEQ compared bulk RNA-seq (Lee et al. 2014). Finally, FISSEQ imaging time consuming, taking 2 3 weeks performed manually (Lee et al. 2015).expansion microscopy, idea FISSEQ revived ExSeq (Alon et al. 2020).

Considering recent novel techniques, CISI, MOSAICA, sci-Space, BOLORAMIS, PIXEL-seq, etc., don’t find new techniques entire field spatial transcriptomics going single direction prefer trade offs.areas seem pursue objectives holy grail. instance, see smFISH based techniques applied increasing number genes time (Figure @smfish-lm-gene), may interest profiling larger number cells (Figure @smfish-lm-cell) novel proofs principle (e.g. CISI, MOSAICA, SABER). Instead, highly multiplexed smFISH datasets smaller number genes complementary scRNA-seq data studies (e.g. (La Manno et al. 2021; Bhaduri et al. 2021; Lu et al. 2021; Bruggen et al. 2021)).However, developments reduce competition areas trade offs without eliminating trade offs. far seems less interest situ sequencing due inefficiency. ISS HybISS developed group Cartana, recent atlases used either favored HybISS, somewhat higher detection efficiency ISS, RCA amplification relatively low detection efficiency, can applied larger areas tissue imaged lower magnification. situ sequencing, also seems trend avoid inefficiency reverse transcription, HybRISS BOLORAMIS.New NGS barcoding techniques seem emphasis high resolution (e.g. single cell high spatial resolution XYZeq), high spatial resolution, different studies seem different emphases objectives holy grail. instance, aiming higher spatial resolution, Slide-seq Stereo-seq papers emphasize scalability tissue (indeed techniques lower detection efficiency), PIXEL-seq paper emphasizes compromising detection efficiency, Seq-Scope paper emphasizes “easy--implement”. Slide-seq2 emphasizes better detection efficiency first version Slide-seq, though improved efficiency still low. NGS based spatial technique attempted rival smFISH detection efficiency. , different emphases highlight trade offs, likely stay us long time. case, spatial transcriptomics might evolve different branches, different types techniques trade offs better suited different types studies.","code":"\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, fig.keep = \"all\",\n                      message = FALSE, warning = FALSE,\n                      fig.align = \"center\")"},{"path":"references.html","id":"references","chapter":"References","heading":"References","text":"“10X VISIUM SPATIAL TRANSCRIPTOMICS.” n.d.
