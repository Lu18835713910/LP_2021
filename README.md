This repository contains the code used to generate figures for [the Museum of Spatial Transcriptomics paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01409-2) and the code used to generate the supplement. The code for figures are in the `paper` directory, and the code for the supplement is in the `supplement` directory. The code can be run on [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/project/2492054). See `supplement/index.Rmd` for instructions to install dependencies to run code in the book; all dependencies have already been installed on RStudio Cloud. The rendered supplement can be seen [here](https://pachterlab.github.io/LP_2021).
