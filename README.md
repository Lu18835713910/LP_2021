This repository contains the code used to generate figures for [the Museum of Spatial Transcriptomics paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.11.443152v2) and the code used to generate the supplementary book. The code for figures are in the `paper` directory, and the code for the book is in the `supplement` directory. The code can be run on [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/project/2492054). See `supplement/index.Rmd` for instructions to install dependencies to run code in the book; all dependencies have already been installed on RStudio Cloud. The rendered book can be seen [here](https://pachterlab.github.io/LP_2021).
