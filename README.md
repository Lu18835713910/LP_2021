This repository contains the code used to generate figures for the Museum of Spatial Transcriptomics paper and the code used to generate the supplementary book. The code for figures are in the `paper` directory, and the code for the book is in the `supplement` directory. The code can be run on [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/project/2492054). See `supplement/index.Rmd` for instructions to install dependencies to run code in the book; all dependencies have already been installed on RStudio Cloud. The rendered book can be seen [here](https://pachterlab.github.io/LP_2021).
