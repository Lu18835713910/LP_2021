<p>The quest to profile the transcriptome in space with high resolution is not new. It started with the enhancer and gene trap screens in the late 1980s and the 1990s, before the genomes of metazoans were sequenced. However, in the prequel era, challenges with the existing technology made the dream of profiling the transcriptome in space hard to reach, as the technologies were not highly-multiplexed and not very quantitative. Over 30 years later, this dream seems to be more within reach, though with some caveats. We have come so far, because of so many strands of ideas and technologies coming together since the late 2010s. Highly multiplexed smFISH that can profile 10000 genes at a time would not have been possible without the reference genome sequence to screen for off target binding, the reference transcriptome and genome annotation with which to design the probes, the technology to synthesize DNA oligos, smFISH, confocal microscopy, digital photography, combinatorial barcoding, and the computing power to store and process terabytes of images. ST and Visium would not have been possible without microarray technology, scRNA-seq techniques designed for small amount of RNA from each spot, NGS, and the computing power to process the data. Some of these strands are older than others, and each of them would not have been possible without more preceding strands coming together. For instance, smFISH would not have been possible without the development of non-radioactive FISH in the late 1970s and the 1980s and techniques to synthesize fluorophore labeled probes. The field of spatial transcriptomics has grown tremendously since the late 2010s, as this is the time when a wide array of technologies truly started to add up to more than the sum of their parts.</p>
<p>Spatial transcriptomics still faces many challenges. First, there still is the trade off between quantity and quality. ST and Visium, which have limited resolution and low detection efficiency, can be more easily applied to larger areas of tissue and the whole transcriptome. ISS has been applied to whole mouse brain sections, because while it has lower detection efficiency than smFISH, the amplified and less crowded signals can be detected at lower magnification. In contrast, while smFISH based techniques have subcellular resolution and often over 80% detection efficiency, the efficiency is compromised when applied to 10000 genes and these techniques are more difficult to apply to larger areas of tissue. As there are still challenges, new techniques to collect data are constantly being developed. Second, compared to the prequel era, the current era is more elitist. While commercial LCM, ST, and Visium have spread far and wide, the various high quality smFISH based techniques mostly failed to spread beyond their usually elite institutions of origin. This might be due to difficulty in building custom flow cells, challenges in customizing the protocols to different tissues, limits in number of genes and cells profiled, lack of core facilities for these techniques, and lack of unified, efficient, open source, and well documented software platform to process the data.</p>
<p>Data analysis has also come a long way, from PCA and ICA in the early 2000s to much more sophisticated techniques today. Many ideas that originated in other fields such as computer vision, machine learning, and statistics, including geospatial statistics, have been adapted to spatial transcriptomics in recent years. Ideas from computer vision include SIFT, NMF, CNN, and to some extent also PCA and ICA. Ideas from machine learning include SVM, neural networks, bag of words, variational autoencoders (for some cases of latent space), mixture of experts model, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> nearest neighbor, and clustering. Ideas from statistics include CCA, permutation testing, MCMC, factor analysis, generalized linear models, and hierarchical modeling. Ideas from geospatial statistics include Gaussian process model (usually used for kriging), spatial point process, and MRF. Other ideas include Laplacian score and optimal transport. Conceivably, more ideas can be adapted to spatial transcriptomics. For instance, spatiotemporal statistics can be adapted to analyze multiple aligned sections of the same tissue to address the difference in covariance between the z axis and the x and y axes. Well established methods in geospatial statistics, such as the semivariogram, J function, G function, and other point process models are also primising for spatial transcriptomics.</p>
<p>We have reviewed many different types of data analysis, using a diverse arsenal of principles. However, integrated analysis pipelines like Seurat are still immature for spatial transcriptomics; Seurat only supports the most rudimentary analyses and the user still needs to learn different syntax and convert data to different formats to use many of the other more specialized and advanced tools, many of which are not well documented. However, the open source culture is flourishing and growing. Most prequel data analysis publications did not link to a repository of the implementation of the software, while most current era data analysis publications do. While the proprietary MATLAB language is still in use, most, especially more recent, current era publication use R, Python, C++, and in some cases Julia and Rust, which are open source and free. Open source software and freely available data may enable less privileged individuals and institutions to perform data analysis and develop new data analysis tools.</p>
<p>What would an ideal future of spatial transcriptomics look like? Data collection would have subcellular resolution, be transcriptome wide, have nearly 100% detection efficiency, and is scalable to large areas of tissues in 3D. Even better, it’s multiomic, profiling not only transcriptome, but also epigenome, proteome, metabolome, and etc., with equally high quality and throughput for the other omics. Moreover, the data collection technique is easy to use, such as coming in easy to use kits, and affordable, so it can spread far and wide into non-elite institutions. It should also be open source and transparent, so it would be easier for others to improve it. While we have reviewed many data analysis methods, a comprehensive benchmark of the methods for each analysis task and evaluation of user experience, like in dynverse for scRNA-seq pseudotime analysis <span class="citation">(Saelens et al. <a href="references.html#ref-Saelens2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>, would be helpful for users to choose a method to use and for developers to compare their new methods to existing methods.</p>
<p>Data analysis would have the same user-friendly user interface for different data types and different methods for the same task. Also, the package should be modular, so dependencies are only installed if needed. It should also be extensible, so users can add additional modules or additional tools for existing tasks to the integrative framework. This would be like SeuratWrappers, which provides Seurat interfaces to data integration and RNA velocity methods not implemented by Seurat. Or like caret and tidymodels, which provide a uniform user interface to numerous machine learning methods. This can be achieved with guidelines such as those used by Bioconductor, encouraging developers to reuse existing data structures and methods in Bioconductor rather than reinventing the wheel. It should also be effective at its task, scalable, well documented, open source, unit tested, easy to install, and portable, again, as enforced to some extent by the Bioconductor guideline. It should be implemented in easy to read code, so developers can more easily fix bugs and improve the package. In addition, it should be interoperable, so tools written in different programming languages can be integrated, combining their strengths and bridging cultural differences between the programming language communities. It should have elegant data visualization, both static for publications and interactive for data exploration and sharing. The data visualization should also be accessible, such as using redundant encoding and colorblind friendly palettes and providing alternatives to those who are visual impaired. Finally, it should be integrated with a graphical user interface (GUI) like iSee so the data can be shared with colleagues who do not code.</p>
